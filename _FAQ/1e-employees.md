#### **1. If my employer provides essential services and I am reporting to work, do I need to provide or carry with me any sort of documentation?**
Currently, you are not required to do so. You are encouraged to confirm with your employer that the function you perform is critical and meant to be performed on-site rather than via telecommuting. Employers are encouraged to provide this confirmation to the employee in writing.

#### **2. Can I go back to my office to pick up personal items?**
All non-essential activities outside the home must be suspended during this period in order to bring the transmission rate down effectively. Please refrain from all non-essential travel to reduce the possibility of transmissions.

#### **3. Can foreign worker levy be waived? Are there any other support measures avaiable for us during this period?**
Additional support measures for businesses will be announced on 6 April 2020. 

#### **4. What will happen to my foreign workers since I am not allowed to operate during this period? Can I repatriate my workers since I cannot operate now?**
Instead of repatriation or retrenchment, we urge employers to first consider cost-saving measures to manage excess manpower. E.g. look at training, redeployment, reasonable adjustment of salaries etc. Please take note of MOM’s guidelines on cost saving measures and retrenchment: [https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment){:target="_blank"}

If it is assessed that the foreigner workers are still not needed, employers may give consent for them to be transferred to other employers facing manpower shortages. Employers can approach SBF at manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg or visit SBF's website.

If foreign workers would like to head home, companies will have to cancel the work passes, repatriate the workers and bare the repatriation cost.

#### **5. I have been told to ramp up production during this time period but cannot find additional manpower, how do I source for workers during this time?**
MOM has partnered with the Singapore Business Federation to offer a temporary scheme that allows companies in all sectors to hire existing WPHs (who are in Singapore) from other sectors, with the agreement of their current employers. 

Companies can also hire existing WPHs from their own or another sector, where the work permits are within 40 days of expiry. This is an extension of a scheme that exists for the construction and process sectors for transfers within their own sectors. Agreement from the current employer is not needed. 

Hiring firms will be required to meet the prevailing criteria under their respective sectors. This temporary scheme will be in place for five months until 31 August 2020. 

For inter-sectoral transfers (earlier than 40 days before work permit expiry), firms can approach SBF at manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg or visit their website for more information. For transfer of WPHs from 40 days before work permit expiry (including inter-sectorial transfers), firms can submit their request via an online form or visit MOM’s website for more information.

#### **6. If the factory is closed, but some of the components are being shipped in, can the company still maintain a minimum number of workers to clear the good?**
Yes, the intention is to keep goods flowing in and to keep the port clear.
