#### **1. What is SafeEntry?**
SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the names, NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to facilitate contact tracing efforts.

SafeEntry is used for data collection and verification at entry/exit points through (1) scanning of a QR code displayed at the venue, or (2) having an identification card with a barcode (e.g. NRIC, driver’s licence, student pass and work permit) scanned by staff.

#### **2. Where does SafeEntry need to be deployed?**
Deployment will be made mandatory for places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods or in enclosed spaces, or where there is high human traffic.

Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/safeentrydeloyment">https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment</a> for the list of places where SafeEntry must be deployed.

#### **3. Why is SafeEntry being expanded to more places?**
As we move towards relaxing the circuit breaker measures, it is even more critical that contact tracing be done well to mitigate the risk of new waves of infection. SafeEntry helps support contact tracing efforts as it provides authorities with a record of individuals who enter and exit places. The records will reduce the time needed to identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients. This is important so that we can continue advancing towards fewer restrictions on our movements, and our daily lives.

#### **4. SafeEntry is already implemented for my building (e.g. Mall), do tenants within the building have to implement SafeEntry as well?**
As part of safe workplace measures, workplaces will have to implement SafeEntry for employees. Further, mandated places listed on <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/safeentrydeloyment">https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment</a>, such as supermarket / hairdresser within a mall, will have to implement SafeEntry for visitors as well.

#### **5. As a SafeEntry enabled business / venue operator, am I required to use SafeEntry for emergency service providers (e.g. SCDF ambulance staff or firefighters) entering the premise during an emergency?**
No. There is already other data available to help in contact tracing efforts when the need arises.

#### **6. I am required under 10B of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 to “as far as is reasonably practicable, obtain and keep the contact particulars of every individual” before allowing him or her to enter my premises, so as to facilitate contact tracing measures. Can I fulfil this by deploying SafeEntry?**
Yes. The deployment of SafeEntry will facilitate the Government’s contact tracing measures, and will fulfil the above requirement under Regulation 10B.

#### **7. Do businesses and venues have to enforce both check in and check out?**
Only check-in for SafeEntry needs to be enforced. This applies to workplaces too.

#### **8. Deployment of SafeEntry can result in significant congestion during certain periods. Can businesses and venues temporarily stand down SafeEntry during these periods?**
It is important to capture information for SafeEntry especially during high footfall periods. Businesses and venues should develop plans so that they are able to implement SafeEntry during all periods.

#### **9. With the implementation of SafeEntry, is the travel and health declaration still required?**
Yes, travel and health declaration is still required, to ensure the safety of individuals within the respective businesses and venues.

#### **10. If I don’t have an NRIC or smartphone, will I be denied entry? What is the alternative should both options be unavailable to a member of public?**
Individuals visiting venues are required to provide the necessary information (i.e. check-in timings) via SafeEntry. Individuals may be denied entry if they do not provide the necessary information. To cater to visitors who do not have a suitable mobile phone to scan QR codes, or do not have their NRIC with them, venue operators are advised to station staff at the various entrance/exit points to assist with a dedicated mobile device for manual check-ins.

#### **11. How will the Government check and ensure that businesses are using SafeEntry? What are the penalties for individuals who flout the rules?**
Businesses are required to use SafeEntry to collect entry information of workers and visitors on their premises for as long as it is required by law during the period of COVID-19.

Businesses that do not comply with the requirement to use SafeEntry will be subject to the penalties stipulated under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act.
