#### **1. What is SafeEntry?**
It is a national digital check-in system that logs the name, NRIC and mobile number of individuals visiting hotspots and venues providing essential services, as well as the information of people working at places providing essential services. SafeEntry will augment existing contact tracing efforts.

SafeEntry is used for data collection and verification through (1) scanning of QR codes, and or (2) scanning of NRICs at hotspots and high traffic locations.

#### **2. Where is this system deployed?**
SafeEntry via scanning of QR codes may be deployed at both hotspots and workplaces providing essential services. The full list can be found at <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/essentialservices" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **3. Who needs to use SafeEntry?**
For businesses: All workplaces with employees that are permitted to work during the Circuit Breaker period are required to log their entry and exit information. Businesses are encouraged to use SafeEntry, or any similar solution provided by the workplace that can support contact tracing. When requested, the data must be provided to MOH to expeditiously support contact tracing.

For individuals: People visiting identified hotspots, and employees who are permitted to work during the circuit breaker period, will be required to log their entry and exit information.

#### **4. Why should we use SafeEntry?**
SafeEntry will support and augment existing contact tracing efforts. It enables the Government to have a record of individuals who enter specific locations where a large number of people tend to gather. This will help facilitate contact tracing should the need arise.

#### **5. What information is collected?**
The individual’s name, NRIC number and mobile number are retrieved for the purpose of contact tracing.

#### **6. How can a business owner sign up for this service?**
Businesses can visit go.gov.sg/safeentry to sign up for this service.

#### **7. What is the cost implication or manpower efforts to run this service?**
This is a free-for-use service. Businesses will be provided with a unique QR code specifically for their location. Businesses are only required to print out their unique QR code and place them prominently at entry and exit points.

#### **8. If businesses already have (other) systems in place to log entry and exit information, how will they be able to show that their systems are robust enough?**
The system needs to log the same data fields as those collected by SafeEntry and provide the data log in a form that can be consumed by MOH in a timely manner.

The solution should be able to track and provide the following in csv format:
- Business Name
- Business/Site Address
- Person’s Name
- Person’s Contact Number
- Person’s NRIC
- Person Date/Time Check-in
- Person Date/Time Check-out

#### **9. Can businesses share the SafeEntry QR code or link with other companies or venues?**
No. The QR code or system link is unique for each on-boarded business and venue. It should not be shared.

Venues with multiple tenants could implement SafeEntry via two ways:
- A single QR code with a selection of tenants. Visitors/ Employees will be able to select which tenant he/she is visiting. He/She will only need to check-in once. Building owners who would like to make use of the above option should write to <a href = "mailto: travelandhealth@myinfo.gov.sg">travelandhealth@myinfo.gov.sg</a>.
- Separate QR codes for each tenant. Visitors/Employees will need to scan multiple times if he/she is visiting multiple tenants.
