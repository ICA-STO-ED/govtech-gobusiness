#### **1. What are some examples of home-based services which can resume in Phase 2? Do they include home-based cleaners or home-based salons?**

Under Phase 2, home-based services, including those involving visitors to the home, will be allowed to resume, as long as they comply with prevailing rules and safe management measures, such as the number of visitors allowed in the home per day.

#### **2. What are some of the personal health and wellness services that may reopen in Phase 2?**
Some of the personal health and wellness services that may reopen include spas, massage centres, fitness studios, gyms and sports facilities. More details on the resumption of activities in Phase 2 will be provided at a later date.
