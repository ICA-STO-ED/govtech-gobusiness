#### **1. Why are treatment modalities like cupping, moxibustion, guasha and tuina massage allowed only if assessed to be necessary?**
Even as we resume more TCM services, managing the current outbreak situation and preventing new clusters from forming remains MOH’s priority. The resumption of more TCM services will be gradual and controlled, as we carefully balance patients’ needs against the larger public health concerns and challenges.

As such, TCM services that involve direct prolonged contact with patients e.g. cupping, moxibustion, guasha and tuina massage, should only be performed after careful assessment by the TCMPs that, if not provided or performed, would result in significant or rapid deterioration of the patient’s medical condition, and potentially threatening their health and well-being.

#### **2. Will there be any practice restrictions as TCM needle acupuncture is allowed for other conditions besides pain management?**
The provision of TCM needle acupuncture for all conditions will be allowed, with the following restrictions:

i. Only TCMPs in TCM clinics and those co-located within a TCM medical hall with dedicated treatment rooms can offer acupuncture treatment;<br>
ii. TCMPs must only perform acupuncture treatment on one patient at any one time i.e. no concurrent treatment of patients even in separate rooms;<br>
iii. Acupuncture treatment should be restricted to once a week per patient on appointment basis. Each session should not exceed 45 minutes; and<br>
iv. Masks must be worn by both TCMPs and patients throughout the acupuncture treatment session. TCMPs must also observe proper infection control guidelines as prescribed below:
- Hand hygiene must be strictly observed.
- Surgical masks, gloves and other protective gear (e.g. disposable gowns when appropriate) must be used when performing acupuncture and manipulative treatment.
- Proper disposal of used acupuncture needles and all other wastes.
- Maintain a clean work environment.

#### **3. Am I allowed to make house calls to deliver permitted TCM services?**
Yes, house calls will be allowed but with the following restrictions:

i. Make a pre-visit phone call on the day of home therapy/home visit to ascertain the patient’s/client’s health condition and potential exposure to COVID-19 prior to the therapy/visit and review the need to proceed with home therapy/home visit;

ii. Consultation and treatment should be restricted to once a week per patient. Each session should not exceed 45 minutes;

iii. Comply with safe distancing measures i.e. minimise interaction with household members/caregivers, safe distancing of at least 1-2m with household members/caregivers, if layout permits; and

iv. Masks must be worn by both TCMPs and patients throughout the consultation and treatment session. TCMPs must also observe proper infection control guidelines as prescribed below: 
- Hand hygiene must be strictly observed.
- Surgical masks, gloves and other protective gear (e.g. disposable gowns when appropriate) must be used when performing acupuncture and manipulative treatment.
- Proper disposal of used acupuncture needles and all other wastes.
- Maintain a clean work environment.

#### **4. Am I allowed to practice at multiple places of practice?**
To minimise infection risk and cross-institutional transmission of COVID-19, TCMPs who wish to practice during phase 1 of post CB period are allowed to do so only at one place of practice.
