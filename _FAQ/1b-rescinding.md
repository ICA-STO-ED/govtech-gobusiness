#### **1. I received an email notification that my previously approved exemption has been rescinded. Why is that so?**
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced on 14 April 2020 that there will be a further tightening of the list of companies that are permitted to operate during the Circuit Breaker period to reduce the number of on-site workers and minimise people movement. We are acutely aware that the circuit breaker will disrupt businesses and be painful, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19.

If you have received an email notification that your exemption has been rescinded, you must suspend all on-site operations at your business premise.

#### **2. I have been asked to suspend operations recently, but I noticed that another company in a similar industry is continuing operations. Why is that so?**
Not all businesses which conduct a similar activity will be permitted to operate. We are keeping the list of businesses that are permitted to operate to a minimum so that we reduce the number of workers who have to work onsite and who have to travel to and from work.  Businesses must adhere to the suspension order unless they have been granted an exemption. If you know of a business operating even though it has not been granted exemption, please report this business and provide relevant details such as its name, address and relevant evidence (eg. photographs) to <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>.

#### **3. I received an email notification that my previously approved exemption has been rescinded. Does this mean I have to suspend business operations immediately?**
Yes. If your exemption has been rescinded, you must cease operations within 24 hours from the email notification timestamp.

#### **4. My application approval has been rescinded. Can I appeal?**
The decision to rescind your exemption is final. Appeals will generally not be granted.

#### **5. My application approval has been rescinded, can I/my staff return to our workplace to pack and make alternative work arrangements? Do I need to apply for time-limited exemptions?**
Everyone should minimise travel outside of their homes. As the owner, you may return to your business facility to take care of crucial tasks that cannot be done remotely or to retrieve necessary materials or documents, without submitting a request for time-limited exemption.

Your employees are not permitted to go to your place of business.  They may work remotely from home.

If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), please apply for a time-limited exemption through <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg</a>. Please note to submit your application **<ins>only one day before</ins>** the date which you would like to activate staff to be deployed at your work premise.

#### **6. Why is there a need to further tighten headcounts even though I am an essential firm? I have already submitted my companyâ€™s plans/manpower requirements.**
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced on 14 April 2020 that there will be a further tightening of the list of companies that are permitted to operate during the Circuit Breaker period to reduce the number of on-site workers and minimise people movement.

Companies that continue to operate during this period should use the minimum number of employees required. You will be required to submit details of your essential employees at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essentialworkers" target="_blank">Essential Employees/Workers Registration</a> from 19 April. 

#### **7. I heard that there are some companies who have received a rescind notification. If I have not received such notification, am I still allowed to operate? Are there any guidelines I should adhere to?**
Yes. Companies which have not received any further notification to suspend their operations are allowed to continue operations, if they had earlier received an exemption from suspension of activities.

Companies which continue operations during this period should ensure the following:
- Cross-deployment or movement of workers across different workplace premises (e.g. different branches) will be disallowed. There should also be no physical interactions between teams working in different locations. For essential service providers who need to move between different locations to perform their services (e.g. IT support, maintenance, logistics, community nurses making house visits), safe distancing measures must be complied to.
- Employers and on-site managers are required to implement strict safe distancing measures within their premises, provide company-arranged transport, to reduce social interactions among workers during their course of work, as well as during their meal and break times. Employers and on-site managers should ensure that workers on-site are wearing masks.
- Employers are required to ensure that their workers have appropriate housing options to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19.

#### **8. What would happen to companies which are found operating even when their exemption approval has been rescinded?**
Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders found operating without an exemption approval will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.
