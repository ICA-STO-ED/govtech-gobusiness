#### **1. Can food handlers at coffee shops sit at the coffee shop to eat? How about staff at F&B outlets?**
Employees including food handlers at coffee shops are allowed to dine-in at their work places. However, employers should ensure that they observe strict safe distancing measures and limit the number of staff dining together at any one point of time. Employers should also cordon off specific spaces for staff dining. Customers are not allowed to dine at the coffee shop.

#### **2. Are ICT retailers allowed to continue operations? And will shops like Challenger, Harvey Norman, that also provide repair services, be opened?**
The physical sales of ICT products and services must cease.

#### **3. Can I continue to fulfil customersâ€™ online orders (non-food) and send the items ordered via delivery during this period?**
Retail businesses can continue to sell their products online and provide delivery and installation services to customers. However, they are not permitted to open their physical stores to customers unless they are an essential service. Delivery and installation personnel are required to comply with the health and safe distancing advisories set out be the government.

#### **4. Is it safe to use reusable containers for takeaway? What if the container was handled by someone who has the virus?**
According to the Singapore Food Authority, there is currently no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food and food packaging that may have been exposed to an infected person. This means that there is a very low risk of spread from food, product and packaging. Members of the public should continue to practice good hygiene habits such as washing their hands regularly. 

#### **5. Will shops selling health products like vitamins/supplements be allowed to open from 2 June?**
No. To manage the risks of transmission, most retail outlets, including those selling health supplements, will have to remain closed until further notice. They may continue to sell their products online and fulfil the orders through delivery.

#### **6. Why is it that F&B establishments in parks cannot operate for takeaway/delivery even during Phase 1?**
This is to minimise movement and interaction amongst the public.  As F&B services in parks are considered less critical consumer services, they will be suspended.

#### **7. Why are food vending machines not allowed to operate in parks even during Phase 1?**
F&B outlets and food vending machines are closed in line with the guideline to minimise movement and interaction of people. Drinks vending machines in parks remain operational. 

#### **8. Are retailers of religious items allowed to continue operations in Phase 1?**
In order to allow members of the public to purchase the items they require for the purpose of praying at home, joss paper shops and shops selling Hindu prayer offerings and flower garlands, will be allowed to open from 4 to 7 June. Outside of this period, the storefronts of these shops will have to remain closed.

While these shops will not be required to apply for any exemptions or approvals to operate from 4 to 7 June, they are required to observe the necessary Safe Distancing Measures such as putting in place a queue management system to minimise crowding within their premises, ensuring that all staff and customers are wearing masks and ensuring at least one-metre spacing between customers at all times.
