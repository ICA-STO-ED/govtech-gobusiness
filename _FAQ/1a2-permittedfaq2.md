#### **1. Are Safe Management Measures mandatory and who should implement them?**
Yes, it is mandatory for all businesses to put in place Safe Management Measures to provide a safe working environment for employees and prevent COVID-19 transmission at the workplace before they resume onsite operations. Businesses must comply with the requirements for Safe Management Measures seen <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/general" target="_blank">here</a> and any sector-specific requirements which apply to them.

#### **2. How do I start preparing my company for the Safe Management requirements?**
The Ministry of Manpower has issued new requirements for employers on the Safe Management measures required of employers allowed to resume their operations after the enhanced circuit breaker period. Details on the Safe Management measures can be found at <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures">https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures</a>.

These measures will help provide a safe working environment and minimise risks of further outbreaks of COVID-19. Employers should implement these Safe Management measures before resuming operations and be prepared to undertake them for as long as necessary.

#### **3. If I am unable to implement all the safe management measures in time. Will I still be allowed to resume operations?**
No. Companies must ensure that all safe management measures are in place before they resume operations.

The Government takes a serious view of any infringement of safe distancing measures and will not hesitate to take actions against non-compliant businesses. 

Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

#### **4. I am having difficulties implementing the safe management measures. Who can I seek help from?**
For enquires on implementing safe management measures at the workplace, please contact <a href="https://go.gov.sg/momcontact">MOM</a> and <a href="https://go.gov.sg/mohfeedback">MOH</a>.

#### **5. Are my employees allowed to have meals together in the pantry?**
Employees should avoid socialising with colleagues within (e.g. in canteen or pantries) and outside of the workplace. Safe distancing of at least one metre should be maintained at all times.

#### **6. How do I ensure that my employees and visitors adhere to Safe Management Measures?**
Employers are required to ensure that Safe Management Measures are in place and communicated to employees prior to resuming work. Employers should have a plan to communicate their Safe Management Measures to employees through their internal communications channels such as emails, notices, and signs to remind employees and visitors to observe the measures.

#### **7. Is my company allowed to arrange physical meetings with external guests?**
Companies that are allowed to resume operations must continue to minimise internal and external meetings between employees and with suppliers/contractors/clients/guests and conduct them virtually where possible. For meetings that need to be held physically, companies should limit the number of attendees and keep the meeting short. Companies should also ensure that all employees and guests adhere to the necessary Safe Management Measures, including ensuring physical spacing of at least one metre between persons at all times.

Companies should also comply with any other additional sector-specific requirements that may have been issued by their respective sector agencies.

#### **8. When will events be allowed to resume?**
Activities or settings where large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces and for prolonged periods of time, are still not allowed to resume in Phase Two as these settings can spawn large clusters of infections, given the number of close contacts between individuals during the course of such activities.

STB has begun to engage relevant businesses and organisations on possible safe management measures to be taken for these activities or settings. STB will advise businesses and organisations on the approval processes and timelines for resumption at a later date.

#### **9. What are some examples of home-based services which can resume in Phase Two? Do they include home-based cleaners or home-based salons?**
Under Phase Two, home-based services, including those involving visitors to the home, will be allowed to resume, as long as they comply with prevailing rules and safe management measures, including the cap of give visitors allowed in the home at any one time. Service providers are required to wear masks and maintain a one metre distancing.

Home-based services that involve customers entering one's home for a prolonged period e.g. private dining and hairdressing services must deploy SafeEntry.
