#### **1. Where can essential employees (e.g. Grab drivers, bus drivers, or those working in the food and beverage industry) take their meals if they are not near home? Do these individuals have to furnish proof of being an essential worker if questioned by enforcement officers?**
Employers of such workers have the responsibility to look after the welfare of their employees and provide them with a suitable sheltered space within the work place premises to consume meals, such as staff canteens, pantries, or any other rest area. Employers should ensure that their employees observe the following in these spaces:
1. Employees should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Staggered meal times to reduce the interactions between their employees and prevent congregation; and
3. Employees should dine quickly and leave the space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals.

If the employees have fixed work stations which are suitable for consuming food, they should also be allowed by their employers to individually consume their meals there.

Premises owners and managers who have employees working within their malls or buildings can designate an area within their premises for these employees to have their meals e.g. part of a food court within a mall.

For essential service and selected service employees whose work requires them to be on the move e.g. delivery services, transport services, or home healthcare services, they should return to their office or homes for their meals. If this is not practical, they can eat in their vehicles, or in public spaces such as void decks, park benches. Employees should observe the following while doing so:
1. Dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Dine quickly and leave the public space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals; and
3. Carry identification to indicate their employment status as essential service and selected service employees, and provide the identification upon request by Safe Distancing Ambassadors, Enforcement Officers, and police officers.

Hawkers and coffeeshop stall operators may consume their meals at tables in front of their stalls. They should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual, not share tables with other individuals or congregate.
