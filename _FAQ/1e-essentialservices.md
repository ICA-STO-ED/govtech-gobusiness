#### **1. How will I know whether my company is carrying out an essential activity and should therefore be exempted from suspension?**
Only essential services are exempted from the suspension. All companies must apply for an exemption to continue operations. Please suspend your business operations until you have received the official email approval.

#### **2. My company provides essential services and I have been contacted by a government agency. Why do I still need to submit details of my operations in order to continue operating?**
This is so that agencies can verify the nature your business activities and assess the number of workers that need to operate on-site. All activities of your company that can take place through telecommuting must be conducted through telecommuting from home.

#### **3. My business is exempted from the suspension, is there anything I should be aware of or put in place?**
Even if your business has been exempted from suspension, you should only get employees to return to the workplace to conduct essential activities where telecommuting is not possible. Where possible, businesses are encouraged to adopt video and audio conferencing tools to support their workers to work from home. In addition, businesses will be required to reduce physical interactions and observe stricter safe distancing measures.

Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home, including temporarily redeploying these employees to another role within the company that is suitable for working from home.

Employers must reduce physical interactions by: 
1. Reducing the need for and duration of physical interactions; 
2. Staggering working hours; 
3. Postponing all group events; and 
4. Implementing shift work and/or split team arrangements. 

F&B establishments are to open for takeaway and/or delivery only. Outlets which do not currently offer take-away and/or delivery should aim to do so, or allow third-party food delivery services to do so for them. While patrons and delivery drivers can continue to enter the premises to access take-away services, there will be no dine-in service, and nobody is permitted to consume any food or drinks on-site whilst waiting for takeaway food. For sustainability, consumers are encouraged to bring your own containers for take-away service. 

Please adhere to the safe distancing measures in the premise. These include minimising crowds by ensuring patrons are spaced at least 1 metre apart at all times (i.e. within the premise and when queuing).

Outlets that remain open are required to adhere to the safe distancing measures. These include minimising crowds by ensuring patrons are spaced at least 1 metre apart at all times (i.e. within the premise and when queuing).

#### **4. Where can essential workers (e.g. Grab drivers, bus drivers, workers working in the food and beverage industry) take their meals if they are not near home? Do these individuals have to furnish proof of being an essential worker if questioned by enforcement officers?**
Employers of such workers have the responsibility to look after the welfare of their workers and provide their workers with a suitable sheltered space within the work place premises to consume meals, such as staff canteens, pantries, or any other rest area. Employers should ensure that their workers observe the following in these spaces:
1. Workers should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Staggered meal times to reduce the interactions between their workers and prevent congregation; and
3. Workers should dine quickly and leave the space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals.

If the workers have fixed work stations which are suitable for consuming food, they should also be allowed by their employers to individually consume their meals there.

Premises owners and managers who have essential service workers working within their malls or buildings can designate an area within their premises for these workers to have their meals e.g. part of a food court within a mall.

For essential service and selected service workers whose work requires them to be on the move e.g. delivery services, transport services, they should return to their office or homes for their meals. If this is not practical, they can eat in their vehicles, or in public spaces such as void decks, park benches. Workers should observe the following while doing so:
1. Dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Dine quickly and leave the public space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals; and
3. Carry identification to indicate their employment status as essential service and selected service workers, and provide the identification upon request by Safe Distancing Ambassadors, Enforcement Officers, and police officers.

Hawkers and coffeeshop stall operators may consume their meals at tables in front of their stalls. They should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual, not share tables with other individuals or congregate.
