#### **1. How will I know whether my company is carrying out an essential activity and should therefore be exempted from suspension?**
Only essential services are exempted from the suspension. All companies must apply for an exemption to continue operations. Please suspend your business operations until you have received the official email approval.

#### **2. My company provides essential services and I have been contacted by a government agency. Why do I still need to submit details of my operations in order to continue operating?**
This is so that agencies can verify the nature your business activities and assess the number of employees that need to operate on-site. All activities of your company that can take place through telecommuting must be conducted through telecommuting from home.

#### **3. As an essential service provider exempted from suspension of business activities, what safe management measures am I required to implement during this period?**
You are required to ensure that your employees: 

-	Only return to the workplace to conduct essential activities where telecommuting is not possible
-	Wear a mask when they leave their homes to go to work as well as while at work 
-	Reduce the need for and duration of physical interactions, such as by adopting video and audio conferencing tools in place of physical meetings 
-	Do not enter the work premises or continue working when unwell
-	Take their temperature and monitor their health daily
-	Maintain 1m separation in the workplace
-	Stagger arrival and departure times
-	Abide by shift work and/or split team arrangements  
-	Are not cross-deployed across different workplace premises e.g. different branches 
-	Do not physically interact between teams working in different locations 
-	Maintain safe distancing (at least one metre apart) at meal/ break times, and avoid social interactions
-	Check-in using SafeEntry (from 12 May 2020). To sign up for this free-to-use service, please visit <a href="https://www.safeentry.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://safeentry.gov.sg</a>. 

If you are in charge of a food delivery service, you must ensure that delivery personnel comply with safe distancing measures, such as to: 

-	Wear a mask at all times during their work
-	Minimise contact with others at all times and not cluster together
-	Observe strict safe distancing (at least one metre apart) from others (including staff from F&B establishments, customers and other delivery personnel) at all times
-	If an F&B outlet is overcrowded, wait outside the establishment, maintain a safe distance from other delivery personnel or customers, and enter the outlet only when the food is ready for collection
-	Keep hands clean by regularly washing them with soap and water or using hand sanitisers

If you utilise the services of food delivery service providers, or run a premise where food delivery services are offered, you must ensure that the delivery personnel observe strict safe distancing from others at all times, at F&B establishments or even when away from the premises, and do not congregate outside or inside the premises.

#### **4. Where can essential employees (e.g. Grab drivers, bus drivers, or those working in the food and beverage industry) take their meals if they are not near home? Do these individuals have to furnish proof of being an essential worker if questioned by enforcement officers?**
Employers of such workers have the responsibility to look after the welfare of their employees and provide them with a suitable sheltered space within the work place premises to consume meals, such as staff canteens, pantries, or any other rest area. Employers should ensure that their employees observe the following in these spaces:
1. Employees should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Staggered meal times to reduce the interactions between their employees and prevent congregation; and
3. Employees should dine quickly and leave the space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals.

If the employees have fixed work stations which are suitable for consuming food, they should also be allowed by their employers to individually consume their meals there.

Premises owners and managers who have employees working within their malls or buildings can designate an area within their premises for these employees to have their meals e.g. part of a food court within a mall.

For essential service and selected service employees whose work requires them to be on the move e.g. delivery services, transport services, or home healthcare services, they should return to their office or homes for their meals. If this is not practical, they can eat in their vehicles, or in public spaces such as void decks, park benches. Employees should observe the following while doing so:
1. Dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Dine quickly and leave the public space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals; and
3. Carry identification to indicate their employment status as essential service and selected service employees, and provide the identification upon request by Safe Distancing Ambassadors, Enforcement Officers, and police officers.

Hawkers and coffeeshop stall operators may consume their meals at tables in front of their stalls. They should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual, not share tables with other individuals or congregate.
