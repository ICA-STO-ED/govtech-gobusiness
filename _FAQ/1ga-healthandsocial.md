#### **1. Can Social Service Agencies and charitable groups continue to deliver essential supplies to needy families during the period of suspension of activities? Can they also enlist volunteers’ help?**
Yes, so long as the necessary precautionary measures are taken (e.g. safe distancing, temperature monitoring, observe good personal hygiene, limit the number of staff/volunteer movement). This is because needy families depend on the essential supplies to survive and such essential supplies should not be interrupted as a result of the suspension of activities. Organisations and volunteers are strongly encouraged to limit their activities to critical and urgent needs (e.g. essential supplies to survive).

#### **2. How are healthcare services in primary care deemed essential or non-essential during the circuit breaker period?**
Essential services/ procedures refer to those, if not provided or performed, would result in significant or rapid deterioration of the patient’s medical condition, and potentially threatening their health and well-being.

Essential primary care services (whose delivery is more time-sensitive) should continue during the circuit breaker period, and non-essential services deferred.

However, doctors should exercise discretion in considering patients’ unique needs, and manage as appropriate based on the following principles:
- Risk assessment of patients’ condition;
- Availability and feasibility of alternative means of consultation (e.g. tele-consultation);
- Availability and feasibility of alternative means of treatment (e.g. remote prescribing and delivery).

#### **3. What primary care preventive health services are considered essential and should continue?**
**a) Childhood vaccinations and childhood developmental screening**
Childhood vaccinations and developmental assessment for 0 to 18 months are considered essential and should continue as scheduled. 

**b) Adult vaccinations**
In general, adult vaccinations are considered non-essential and should be deferred. However, the doctor may consider proceeding with influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations if the patient is being seen for essential routine chronic care. 

**c) Routine surveillance for chronic disease and cancer screening**
In general, routine surveillance for chronic diseases and cancer in well individuals is considered non-essential and should be deferred. However, diagnostic work-up for abnormal physical findings and surveillance for patients at higher risk (e.g. patients with strong familial syndromes) may continue if the doctor assesses that it is not in the patient’s best interest for these to be deferred. 

#### **4. Are Allied Health Services allowed to continue operations during the Circuit Breaker period?**
With the extension of the Circuit Breaker period until 1 June 2020, the Ministry of Health has re-categorised outpatient non-public healthcare institution (PHI) allied health services (AHS) including psychology as “essential services” effective from 29 April onwards. New measures for allowing the provision of non-PHI AHS will be implemented on a systematic and incremental basis. You may refer to the guidelines <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/essentialservices/healthandsocialservices/" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **5. Should group practices/Primary Care Networks (PCNs) suspend services for support staff (e.g. human resource, IT, logistics, finance)?**
Support services which ensure the provision of essential services at GP clinics will be allowed to continue. Please minimise the number of staff based on-site. If employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, employers must ensure that they do so. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of physical meetings wherever possible.

#### **6. Will the suppliers or vendors providing supplies or services for my clinic be allowed to operate, e.g. cleaners, waste disposal services, pharmaceutical companies?**
Suppliers or vendors providing essential services can continue to operate.

#### **7. Can house calls and home visits continue?**
Requests for house visits should first be screened over the telephone. If further in-person medical assessment is deemed necessary, the doctor should then assess if a house visit is essential, or if it is more appropriate for an appointment to be scheduled at the clinic.

#### **8. Why are treatment modalities like cupping, moxibustion, guasha and tuina massage allowed only if assessed to be necessary?**
Even as we resume more TCM services, managing the current outbreak situation and preventing new clusters from forming remains MOH’s priority. The resumption of more TCM services will be gradual and controlled, as we carefully balance patients’ needs against the larger public health concerns and challenges.

As such, TCM services that involve direct prolonged contact with patients e.g. cupping, moxibustion, guasha and tuina massage, should only be performed after careful assessment by the TCMPs that, if not provided or performed, would result in significant or rapid deterioration of the patient’s medical condition, and potentially threatening their health and well-being.

#### **9. Will there be any practice restrictions as TCM needle acupuncture is allowed for other conditions besides pain management?**
The provision of TCM needle acupuncture for all conditions will be allowed, with the following restrictions:

i. Only TCMPs in TCM clinics and those co-located within a TCM medical hall with dedicated treatment rooms can offer acupuncture treatment;<br>
ii. TCMPs must only perform acupuncture treatment on one patient at any one time i.e. no concurrent treatment of patients even in separate rooms;<br>
iii. Acupuncture treatment should be restricted to once a week per patient on appointment basis. Each session should not exceed 45 minutes; and<br>
iv. Masks must be worn by both TCMPs and patients throughout the acupuncture treatment session. TCMPs must also observe proper infection control guidelines as prescribed below:
- Hand hygiene must be strictly observed.
- Surgical masks, gloves and other protective gear (e.g. disposable gowns when appropriate) must be used when performing acupuncture and manipulative treatment.
- Proper disposal of used acupuncture needles and all other wastes.
- Maintain a clean work environment.

#### **10. Am I allowed to make house calls to deliver essential TCM services?**
Yes, house calls will be allowed but with the following restrictions:

i. Make a pre-visit phone call on the day of home therapy/home visit to ascertain the patient’s/client’s health condition and potential exposure to COVID-19 prior to the therapy/visit and review the need to proceed with home therapy/home visit;

ii. Consultation and treatment should be restricted to once a week per patient. Each session should not exceed 45 minutes;

iii. Comply with safe distancing measures i.e. minimise interaction with household members/caregivers, safe distancing of at least 1-2m with household members/caregivers, if layout permits; and

iv. Masks must be worn by both TCMPs and patients throughout the consultation and treatment session. TCMPs must also observe proper infection control guidelines as prescribed below: 
- Hand hygiene must be strictly observed.
- Surgical masks, gloves and other protective gear (e.g. disposable gowns when appropriate) must be used when performing acupuncture and manipulative treatment.
- Proper disposal of used acupuncture needles and all other wastes.
- Maintain a clean work environment.

#### **11. Am I allowed to practice at multiple places of practice?**
To minimise infection risk and cross-institutional transmission of COVID-19, TCMPs who wish to practice during phase 1 of post CB period are allowed to do so only at one place of practice.
