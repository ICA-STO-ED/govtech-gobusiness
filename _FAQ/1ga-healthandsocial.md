#### **1. Can Social Service Agencies and charitable groups continue to deliver essential supplies to needy families during the period of suspension of activities? Can they also enlist volunteers’ help?**
Yes, so long as the necessary precautionary measures are taken (e.g. safe distancing, temperature monitoring, observe good personal hygiene, limit the number of staff/volunteer movement). This is because needy families depend on the essential supplies to survive and such essential supplies should not be interrupted as a result of the suspension of activities. Organisations and volunteers are strongly encouraged to limit their activities to critical and urgent needs (e.g. essential supplies to survive).

#### **2. How are healthcare services in primary care deemed essential or non-essential during the circuit breaker period?**
Essential services/ procedures refer to those, if not provided or performed, would result in significant or rapid deterioration of the patient’s medical condition, and potentially threatening their health and well-being.

Essential primary care services (whose delivery is more time-sensitive) should continue during the circuit breaker period, and non-essential services deferred.

However, doctors should exercise discretion in considering patients’ unique needs, and manage as appropriate based on the following principles:
- Risk assessment of patients’ condition;
- Availability and feasibility of alternative means of consultation (e.g. tele-consultation);
- Availability and feasibility of alternative means of treatment (e.g. remote prescribing and delivery).

#### **3. What primary care preventive health services are considered essential and should continue?**
**a) Childhood vaccinations and childhood developmental screening**
Childhood vaccinations and developmental assessment for 0 to 18 months are considered essential and should continue as scheduled. 

**b) Adult vaccinations**
In general, adult vaccinations are considered non-essential and should be deferred. However, the doctor may consider proceeding with influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations if the patient is being seen for essential routine chronic care. 

**c) Routine surveillance for chronic disease and cancer screening**
In general, routine surveillance for chronic diseases and cancer in well individuals is considered non-essential and should be deferred. However, diagnostic work-up for abnormal physical findings and surveillance for patients at higher risk (e.g. patients with strong familial syndromes) may continue if the doctor assesses that it is not in the patient’s best interest for these to be deferred. 

#### **4. Are Allied Health Services allowed to continue operations during the Circuit Breaker period?**
With the extension of the Circuit Breaker period until 1 June 2020, the Ministry of Health has re-categorised outpatient non-public healthcare institution (PHI) allied health services (AHS) including psychology as “essential services” effective from 29 April onwards. New measures for allowing the provision of non-PHI AHS will be implemented on a systematic and incremental basis. You may refer to the guidelines <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/essentialservices/healthandsocialservices/" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **5. Should group practices/Primary Care Networks (PCNs) suspend services for support staff (e.g. human resource, IT, logistics, finance)?**
Support services which ensure the provision of essential services at GP clinics will be allowed to continue. Please minimise the number of staff based on-site. If employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, employers must ensure that they do so. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of physical meetings wherever possible.

#### **6. Will the suppliers or vendors providing supplies or services for my clinic be allowed to operate, e.g. cleaners, waste disposal services, pharmaceutical companies?**
Suppliers or vendors providing essential services can continue to operate.

#### **7. Can house calls and home visits continue?**
Requests for house visits should first be screened over the telephone. If further in-person medical assessment is deemed necessary, the doctor should then assess if a house visit is essential, or if it is more appropriate for an appointment to be scheduled at the clinic.
