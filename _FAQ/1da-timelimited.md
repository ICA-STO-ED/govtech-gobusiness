#### **1. I have previously applied for 4 Time-Limited Exemptions (TLEs). Given that the circuit breaker period has been extended until 1 June, will I be able to apply for additional TLEs?**
With effect from 26 April 2020, each company will be allowed to apply for Time-Limited Exemptions only twice every week, regardless of the number of applications that you/your company had submitted prior to 26 Apr 2020. You will have a 24-hour window to submit your applications prior to the deployment of your staff.

For example, if you need to deploy your staff on 28 April 2020, you will need to submit your application between 12.01pm on 26 April 2020 â€“ 12.00pm on 27 April 2020.

#### **2. When will the limit of 2 applications for Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) reset each week?**
The limit of 2 applications will reset every Sunday, 12.00pm.

#### **3. What should I do if I need to apply for the Time-Limited Exemption more than twice in the same week?**
Further appeals will not be considered.

#### **4. What is my timeline for submission of Time-Limited Exemption application?**
You will have a 24-hour window to submit your applications prior to the deployment of your staff.

#### **5. When will I know whether my Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) application has been approved?**
You will receive an acknowledgement email of the approval of your TLE application.

#### **1. What should I do if I need to deploy my manpower very urgently (i.e. less than 24-hour notice period)?**
You are required to apply for the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/timelimitedexemption" target="_blank">Time-Limited Exemption (TLE)</a> before deploying your staff. You will have a 24-hour window to submit your applications prior to the deployment of your staff. You are encouraged to plan for deployment of manpower accordingly.
