#### **2. I have previously applied for 4 Time-Limited Exemptions (TLEs). Given that the circuit breaker period has been extended until 1 June, will I be able to apply for additional TLEs?**
With effect from 26 April 2020, you will be allowed to submit up to 2 TLE applications each week[^1]. This is regardless of the number of applications that you/your company had submitted prior to 26 Apr 2020.

Please submit your application one day before the on-site deployment of your staff.

Please note that the total number of employees activated should not exceed 10, or 25% of the total number of employees in your company, whichever is lower.

#### **3. How many times can I apply for Time-Limited Exemptions (TLEs)?**
You will be allowed to submit up to 2 TLE applications each week[^1]. This is regardless of the number of applications that you/your company had submitted prior to 26 Apr 2020.

You are encouraged to plan for deployment of manpower accordingly.

#### **4. What should I do if I need to apply for the Time-Limited Exemption more than twice in the same week?**
Further appeals will not be considered.

#### **5. When will I know whether my Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) application has been approved?**
You will receive an acknowledgement email of the approval of your TLE application.

#### **6. What should I do if I need to deploy my manpower very urgently (i.e. less than 24-hour notice period)?**
You are required to apply for the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/timelimitedexemption" target="_blank">Time-Limited Exemption (TLE)</a> one day before deploying your staff. You are encouraged to plan for deployment of manpower accordingly.

#### **7. Can I cancel or void my Time-Limited Exemption application if there are changes in my manpower deployment plans?**
A Time-Limited Exemption application cannot be cancelled or voided once it has been submitted regardless of circumstances. It will still be counted towards your submission quota of twice per week.
