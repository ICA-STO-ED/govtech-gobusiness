#### **1. I have previously applied for 4 Time-Limited Exemptions (TLEs). Given that the circuit breaker period has been extended until 1 June, will I be able to apply for additional TLEs?**
With effect from 26 April 2020, each company will be allowed to apply for Time-Limited Exemptions only twice every week (week starting on Sunday), regardless of the number of applications that you/your company had submitted prior to 26 Apr 2020.

For example, you will need to submit your application on Sundays, for on-site deployment of your staff on Mondays.

#### **2. When will the limit of 2 applications for Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) reset each week?**
The limit of 2 applications will reset every Sunday, 11:59pm.

#### **3. What should I do if I need to apply for the Time-Limited Exemption more than twice in the same week?**
Further appeals will not be considered.

#### **4. When will I know whether my Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) application has been approved?**
You will receive an acknowledgement email of the approval of your TLE application.

#### **5. What should I do if I need to deploy my manpower very urgently (i.e. less than 24-hour notice period)?**
You are required to apply for the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/timelimitedexemption" target="_blank">Time-Limited Exemption (TLE)</a> before deploying your staff. You will have a 24-hour window to submit your applications prior to the deployment of your staff. You are encouraged to plan for deployment of manpower accordingly.
