#### **1. Is it safe to use reusable containers for takeaway? What if the container was handled by someone who has the virus?**
According to the Singapore Food Authority, there is currently no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food and food packaging that may have been exposed to an infected person. This means that there is a very low risk of spread from food, product and packaging. Members of the public should continue to practice good hygiene habits such as washing their hands regularly. 

#### **2. Do I need to apply for an exemption to resume operations for Phase Two?**
F&B and retail establishments that are allowed to open in Phase Two need not apply for an exemption before resuming operations. A class exemption to resume business will be granted by MTI. 

However, please note that you will need to submit manpower details via the <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg" target="_blank">GoBusiness portal</a> within two weeks from 19 June 2020.

#### **3. Will bars or entertainment venues that offer food and hot snacks be allowed to provide dine-in options if they do not provide live music performances, dancing or karaoke activities (i.e. just F&B)?**
Bars (licensed by SFA under ‘Pubs, Bars, Nightclub, Discos') and entertainment venues (licensed by SPF under the Public Entertainment Act) are not allowed to open, and hence cannot provide dine-in options during Phase Two.

#### **4. What are the safe management measures F&B establishments need to implement for dine-in?**
With effect from 19 June 2020, dine-in for F&B establishments (except those with SFA food shop licences under the Pubs, Bars, Nightclubs and Discos categories) is allowed. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/media-centre/media-releases/2020/june/advisory-for-phase-2-re-opening-of--food-and-beverage-establishments" target="_blank">advisory for Phase Two Re-opening of Food & Beverage Establishments</a> for details on the applicable safe management measures. 

#### **5. I own a F&B establishment within a mall. Am I required to implement SafeEntry and conduct temperature taking/checks on visible symptoms, since visitors who entered the malls are already required to do so?**
All F&B establishments with seated diners must implement SafeEntry to facilitate the efficient collection of customer information for contact tracing when needed. 

All F&B establishments with seated diners must also conduct temperature taking of customers and checks on visible symptoms, except if they are located in malls which are already doing so. They should however do so, if they operate outside the mall hours.

#### **6. What are the visible symptoms to check for and how should I check this?**
Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose.

These would be noticeable symptoms. Advise those who appear unwell to see a doctor before turning them away.

#### **7. Are we allowed to hold sales and promotional activities within our F&B outlets?**
F&B establishments should avoid activities that would attract crowds in and outside of their premises (e.g. providing special discounts or offers for dine-in), for at least two weeks from Phase Two reopening. This is to facilitate crowd management.

Outlets may continue with ongoing promotional activities for online delivery and takeaway orders, but must also take note to minimise long queues of customers and delivery personnel at the shopfront. Outlets are encouraged to adopt a tiered pricing strategy where applicable to support staggered meal hours, particularly at locations that attract large crowds.  

#### **8. For related diners, do they still need to take alternative seats when they are dining together?**
Each table or group must be limited to five or fewer persons, with at least one-metre spacing between tables or groups. In situations where groups are unable to be separated one metre apart from each other due to fixed furniture, alternate tables (or seats between groups) must be marked out instead.

#### **9. Are there guidelines for diners on when they can remove their mask and how soon would they need to put it back on?**
Dine-in customers are required to wear their masks at all times except when eating and drinking. 

#### **10. Can F&B establishments serve alcohol? If so, can the bar counters in the restaurants be opened?**
Only permitted F&B establishments are allowed to operate and provide dine-in services. Such outlets can serve alcohol along with the meals. 

Bar counters within the restaurants are considered higher-risk areas where there is a higher likelihood of customers mixing between groups and socialising/mingling. F&B establishments can mitigate the risk by seating customers on stools or clearly demarcating the boundaries for each dining area to ensure separation of at least one metre between groups at all times. F&B establishments should also refrain from serving drinks-only menu at the bar counters.

#### **11. All malls and large standalone stores (>930sqm) must comply with the occupancy limit of 10 sqm per person stipulated. What is the basis for this?**
The occupancy limit is meant to help malls and standalone stores operationalise the requirement of ensuring sufficient physical distancing between visitors and avoid overcrowding within the premise. 

In addition to the occupancy limit, malls and standalone stores must also ensure that they comply with other safe distancing measures, e.g. dispersion of groups of more than five people and physical distancing of at least one metre in queues.

#### **12. How can a mall/ standalone store manage the number of shoppers to ensure compliance with the occupancy limit of one person per 10 sqm of Gross Floor Area (GFA)?**
Malls and standalone stores can consider continuing to reduce the number of entrances and deploy queue management systems or staff to control the number of visitors entering and leaving the premises, to ensure compliance with the allowable visitor capacity. 

The reduction in the number of entrances should not lead to a congregation of visitors outside the mall. Malls must make sure that there is at least one metre spacing between persons standing in queues, including those outside the mall.

#### **13. Are in-store and mall promotions e.g. sales and special offers, allowed in Phase Two?**
Retailers should avoid activities that would attract crowds in and outside of the retail establishment (e.g. providing special discounts or offers for reopening) for at least two weeks from Phase Two reopening. This is to prevent crowds and long queues of customers and delivery personnel at the store front.

Sales and promotions for purchases online are allowed, where purchases are delivered to customers directly. Customers are also allowed to collect such online purchases in the store. Stores are advised to set up a separate queue for online collections to enable a quick collection of goods purchased online. However, they must also take note to minimise long queues of customers and delivery personnel at the shopfront.

#### **14. Are in-store events and activities or mall atrium activities allowed?**
Activities and events in stores or mall atriums must not be held.  

#### **15. What are the visible symptoms to check for and how should I check this? As a mall operator, can I turn away all customers who appear unwell?**
Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose.

These would be noticeable symptoms. Those who appear unwell should be turned away, except where the individual is entering the mall to seek medical treatment for a specified symptom.
 
#### **16. Will malls be held accountable if their tenants do not comply with the safe management measures?**
Government agencies will step up enforcement efforts to ensure the proper implementation of the safe management measures. If establishments are found to be non-compliant, they will be guided on finding suitable solutions. Subsequently, periodic checks will be conducted to ensure compliance. Mall operators are to provide assistance to tenants who may need it. 

Businesses, including mall operators and their tenants, are accountable for their own safe management measures. If they do not implement or comply with the government’s advisories, they may be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance. They may also face fines and jail terms under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, depending on the extent of their infringement.

#### **17. For retailers who have to cross-deploy their staff, what are the additional safeguards that they have to put in place to minimise the risk of cross infection?**
There should be no cross deployment or interaction between employees in different shifts, teams or worksites, even outside of work.

If cross deployment cannot be avoided due to operational reasons such as the nature of the job, e.g. IT personnel, truck drivers or managerial staff supporting different office/store locations, retailers must take additional safeguards to minimise the risk of cross infection, e.g. minimise the number of premises that workers are cross-deployed to, put in place systems to ensure no direct contact with the cross-deployed personnel.

#### **18. Are testers and samples allowed?**
All product testers and samples that require customer contact e.g. cosmetics and food samples, must be removed.

#### **19. Are paid kiddy rides/indoor playgrounds/family entertainment centres permitted to resume operations?**
No. Paid kiddy rides, indoor playgrounds and family entertainment centres are not permitted to resume operations as they are considered a form of entertainment. 

#### **20. Are game arcades/claw machines permitted to resume operations?**
No, they must remain closed as they are considered a form of entertainment.

#### **21. Are vending machines permitted to open?**
Yes, vending machines are permitted to open.

#### **22. Are retail businesses who conduct their businesses from their outdoor display areas outside their retail shops permitted to resume operations?**
Yes. Retail businesses are allowed to reopen their shopfronts from 19 June 2020, including operating from their outdoor display areas outside their shops. 

Retailers are required to implement safe management measures.
