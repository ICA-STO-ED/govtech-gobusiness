#### **1. Which groups of foreign employees are covered under this policy?**
This policy applies to foreign employees in the construction sector only (WP holders, S Pass holders and Dependent Pass holders tagged to S Pass only) who are residing in a Specified Place of Accommodation, except any dormitory gazetted as an “isolation area”, or any dormitory licensed under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act 2015.

#### **2. How do I check if this Stay Home Notice applies to my company and/or to my foreign employees?**
Employers can check whether the Stay Home Notice (SHN) applies to their company and their foreign employees by logging on to <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/wp-online-for-businesses-and-employment-agencies" target="_blank">Work Permit (Online)</a> to see if they have received a SHN notification.

Foreign employees who are Work Permit or S Pass holders can check their Work Permit and S Pass cards to see if their sector is listed as “Construction”.

#### **3. My company is in the construction sector (based on SSIC code) but my foreign employee works in the office/factory and not at the construction site. Is he/she still required to be placed on SHN?**
Yes. All Work Permit or S Pass holders in the construction sector (based on SSIC code) have to be placed on SHN.

#### **4. My company is not in the construction sector (based on SSIC code), but our foreign employees, provide services at construction sites (e.g. vector control, cleaning etc.). Are they required to be placed on SHN?**
No. As your foreign employees are not classified under the construction sector, they do not need to be placed on SHN.

#### **5. Does the SHN apply to foreign employees on Quarantine Order in government quarantine facilities?**
No. After these employees have completed their Quarantine Order during the SHN period (i.e. 20 April to 18 May 2020), they do not need to be placed on SHN.

#### **6. Why is the SHN not imposed on foreign employees from other sectors?**
MOM is implementing this requirement on all foreign employees in the construction sector, as the highest number of infected cases have come from this sector, and worksite transmissions have been a contributing factor. The SHN will help prevent further transmission of the virus between foreign employees in this sector, across all housing types.

#### **7. Why is the SHN not imposed on employment pass holders from the construction sector?**
Employment pass (EP) holders are generally less exposed to the worksites and live in non-communal premises.

#### **8. How long is the SHN period for this policy?**
The SHN period for these foreign employees is 20 April 2020, 0000hrs to 18 May 2020, 2359hrs.

## **Extension of Stay Home Notice**

#### **9. Why was the SHN for foreign employees in the Construction Sector extended to 18 May?**
Since the start of the SHN, agencies have been closely monitoring the infections among construction employees living outside purpose-built dormitories (PBD). The number of infected construction work pass holders living in non-PBD premises continues to rise. Their incidence/prevalence remains noticeably higher than the general community. This suggests that transmission at construction worksites among such employees had occurred before the start of the SHN period. The cases that are now being observed could have been incubated earlier or may have spread among the employees’ close contacts and house-mates.

Unlike most individuals who serve their SHN in isolation, the construction work pass holders are likely to be in shared accommodation where they have continued interactions with one another. Based on MOH’s public health assessment, an extension of the SHN by a further 14 days to cover another incubation cycle will help to break the cycle of transmission. Hence, after careful consideration, MOM and BCA have decided to extend the SHN until 18 May 2020, 2359hrs.

#### **10. If my employees have already been approved to carry out essential services, do I need to apply for approval again?**
No re-application is needed. Employers, whose foreign employees have been approved by BCA to carry out essential services during the SHN, may continue these works until the end of the extended SHN period (i.e. this will supersede the project end date indicated), **unless** they receive an email notification informing them that their approvals have been terminated by BCA. 

#### **11. I have been informed by BCA that my approval for SHN exemption is terminated. How do I appeal?**
Please submit your appeal via this link <a href="https://go.gov.sg/appeal-bca-continue-works" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/appeal-bca-continue-works</a>. New appeals will continue to be subject to BCA’s approval on a case-by-case basis.

## **Issues related to Employment, Salary and Support**

#### **12. Are my foreign employees eligible for any form of SHN support?**
The Government announced on 6 April 2020 that employers would be given a waiver of the March 2020 Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) due in April to help firms cut costs and improve their cashflow. Employers will also receive a one-off FWL rebate of $750 for each Work Permit or S Pass holder, for levies paid in 2020. On 25 April 2020, MOM further announced an additional FWL rebate of $750 for each work permit or S Pass holder in employment as at 1 May 2020, and a waiver of the April 2020 FWL due in May, to help companies during the extended Circuit Breaker period.

In view of the levy waiver and rebate that is provided, employers of such employees will not separately receive an SHN allowance.

#### **13. Do I need to pay my foreign employees their salary during their SHN?**
Employers must treat their foreign employees fairly and responsibly, taking into consideration the levy waiver for the March 2020 Foreign Worker Levy (FWL), as well the FWL rebate of $750 for each Work Permit or S Pass holder for levies paid in 2020, that has been provided by the Government. On 25 April 2020, MOM further announced an additional FWL rebate of $750 for each work permit or S Pass holder in employment as at 1 May 2020, and a waiver of the April 2020 FWL due in May, to help companies during the extended Circuit Breaker period.

Employers must continue to be responsible for their maintenance and upkeep and work out salary arrangements with the unions and employees, especially for the low-wage work permit holders who may need more support.

For this SHN period, employers are strongly encouraged to provide additional paid leave, allow their employees to take paid sick leave, hospitalisation leave, advanced paid leave, or mutually agree on other arrangements with their employees.

#### **14. My foreign employees are working in essential services, as approved by MTI. Does the SHN period apply to them? Can I seek an exemption?**
Yes, the SHN also applies to foreign employees (work permit or S pass holders in the construction sector) who work in essential services. Should your company wish to apply for an exemption, please submit your appeal at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/appeal-bca-continue-works" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/appeal-bca-continue-works</a>. BCA will assess your appeal on a case-by-case basis and the number of foreign employees approved may also be limited.

For further enquiries relating to exemption, please contact BCA <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform" target="_blank">here</a>. 

#### **15. Is there a cut-off date to submit the appeal to BCA?**
There is no cut-off date to submit the appeal. We encourage firms to apply as soon as possible so that they can continue to provide essential services.

#### **16. Can my employees continue working while waiting for results of the appeal?**
BCA will send a reply to your application as soon as they can via <a href = "mailto: bca_covid19@bca.gov.sg">bca_covid19@bca.gov.sg</a>. Meanwhile, please do not proceed with works involving your foreign employees until you have received your appeal results from BCA. 

## **Compliance and penalties**

#### **17. What are the penalties for non-compliance for this SHN period?**
Employers and foreign employees have a joint duty to ensure that employees behave responsibly and comply to the SHN period. MOM will not hesitate to revoke the work passes and withdraw work pass privileges against errant employers or employees. This SHN is imposed on employees pursuant to the Section 7(4A) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.

#### **18. What is the advice for my foreign employees placed on SHN?**
Foreign employees placed on SHN are not allowed to leave their place of residence for the SHN duration, even if it is to purchase food and essentials.

They should not have visitors at their residence. They should practise safe distancing measures by maintaining a physical distancing of at least 1 metre from another person, stay within their rooms, and minimise interactions with other foreign employees living in the same space at the residence. They should also keep the premises clean and well maintained. You may refer to the SHN notification for more information.

#### **19. What should employees do if they are asked to work during their 14-days’ SHN?**
Employers and employees have a joint duty to ensure that employees behave responsibly during the SHN period, and not return to the workplace. MOM will not hesitate to revoke the work passes and withdraw work pass privileges against errant employers or employees. SHN is imposed on employees pursuant to the Section 7(4A) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.

If employers insist for employees to return to your workplace, employees may report the matter to MOM at <a href = "mailto: MOM_QOps@mom.gov.sg">MOM_QOps@mom.gov.sg</a>.

#### **20. What should employees do if they are evicted from their ‘Specified Place of Accommodation’ because they are on SHN?**
Employees can report the matter to MOM at MOM_QOps@mom.gov.sg or call 6438 5122.

#### **21. What resource do evicted foreign employees have? How may they recover rent money paid in advance to landlords?**
Tenants considering actions against landlords, including for recovery of money, may wish to consider if there is a breach of tenancy agreement before pursuing further action. You may seek legal advice. If you do not have legal counsel of your own, you may visit the following free legal clinics:
- On-site Legal Advice Scheme operated by the Community Justice Centre located at the State Courts Building
- Catholic Lawyers’ Guild legal clinic at AGAPE Village

You may also visit Law Society Pro Bono Services’ website <a href="https://www.lawsocprobono.org/pages/community-legal-clinic.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.lawsocprobono.org/pages/community-legal-clinic.aspx</a> for a list of free legal clinics in Singapore.

Subject to your lawyer’s advice, you may consider filing a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) if the duration of your lease of residential premises does not exceed 2 years. The SCT provides a low-cost and simple dispute resolution process for claims up to $20,000 (or $30,000 with both parties’ consent). You may submit the claim online, at http://www.statecourts.gov.sg/CJTS/. You do not need a lawyer to represent you. In fact, in SCT proceedings, lawyers are not allowed to represent any of the parties, including your landlord.

## **Employers’ Responsibilities to their Foreign Employees**

#### **22. As an employer, am I responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of my foreign employees during their SHN?**
As an employer, you will be required to make arrangement to deliver sufficient food and other daily essentials to your foreign employees for the SHN Period, as they are not allowed to leave their premises to purchase these.

You shall also ensure that all necessary arrangements for the foreign employees’ non-emergency medical needs (such as arranging a visit to a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (“PHPC”) or General Practitioner (“GP”) clinic nearest to the foreign employee’s Specified Place of Accommodation, re-scheduling follow-up visits for chronic conditions, refilling of prescriptions, etc) are made.

#### **23. The Advisory states that employers must arrange to deliver food to their foreign employees during the SHN period, as they are not allowed to leave their place of residence. Are there other options besides catered food delivery? Must employers bear the full cost of the food/groceries?**
Employers are required to ensure sufficient food and other daily essentials are provided to their foreign employees during the SHN period.

Employers can do so through various options:

(i) For foreign employees staying in factory-converted dormitories, construction living quarters and temporary living quarters:
    - Arrange for delivery of catered meals as they should not cook at the communal cooking facilities to minimise the risk of transmission.

(ii) For foreign employees staying HDB flats and private residential properties:
    - Ask the employees to order in groceries for cooking or catered meals
    - Arrange for delivery of groceries for cooking or catered meals

Employers may choose to reimburse their employees for the cost of food/groceries provided or work out a mutual agreement on how the cost will be borne between the employer and employee.

As Ramadan is round the corner, we advise employers of Muslim Construction Foreign Employees in Factory-Converted Dormitories, Construction Temporary Quarters, Temporary Occupation License quarters and Temporary Living Quarters to make arrangements with the caterers to deliver food at the appropriate timings, as per the daily guidelines from MUIS, for their Muslim employees’ pre-dawn and break-fast meals during Ramadan (24 April 2020 to 23 May 2020).

Employers of Muslim Foreign Employees in Private Residential Premises and HDB flats may arrange for groceries to be delivered ahead of time or tap on round-the-clock food delivery services.

#### **24. As an employer, what steps should I take to ensure my foreign employees’ health?**
You will need to instruct your foreign employees to monitor themselves for any signs of fever, cough and breathlessness or a runny nose. You must ensure that your foreign employees have a thermometer to record their temperature, twice a day. If your foreign employees do not have thermometers, you are to provide thermometers to your foreign employees.

#### **25. As an employer, what should I do if my foreign employee falls ill during his SHN?**
If any of your foreign employees develop fever, cough or breathlessness, or are feeling unwell, they should seek medical attention immediately from the residence manager, and contact you, as their employer, for assistance to go to the hospital or any outpatient clinic.

Please inform the staff and doctor of your foreign employee’s symptoms. All persons must wear a surgical mask when going outside the residence (whether to seek medical assistance or otherwise), and do not take public transport.

In emergency situations (e.g. difficulty in breathing), call 995 for an ambulance to take your foreign employees to the hospital. Please inform the 995 operator of your foreign employee’s symptoms.

Please also inform MOM of such cases immediately, by sending a WhatsApp message to MOM at 8361 8932 or emailing <a href = "mailto: mom_feda@mom.gov.sg">mom_feda@mom.gov.sg</a> with the following information:
- Name of Resident;
- FIN number;
- Hospital conveyed to (where applicable).

#### **26. My foreign employees have medical appointments scheduled during the SHN period/ would like to visit the doctor as they are feeling ill. Can he/she do so?**
All foreign employees under SHN are allowed to go for both urgent and non-urgent medical appointments, or to visit the doctor if they are feeling unwell. For medical appointments, they are required to submit proof of documentation (e.g. MC, doctor’s letter) to <a href = "mailto: MOM_QOps@mom.gov.sg">MOM_QOps@mom.gov.sg</a> before going for their appointment. For visits to the doctor, they are required to ask for proof of documentation.

If MOM staff checks in with them via phone/video call, your foreign employees would need to show this documentation to explain why they were found outside their residential premises during the SHN period.

When visiting the doctor, your foreign employees are required to wear a mask at all times, minimise contact with others and practise safe distancing measures.

#### **27. My foreign employee has been placed on SHN. However, he originally intended to move house before the SHN began, as his lease at his current location is ending. Is he allowed to move house during the SHN period?**
Foreign employees under SHN are allowed to move house if they had originally intended to so before the SHN was released, and if their lease at their current location is ending. They are required to submit proof of documentation (e.g. the previous lease agreement and new lease agreement) to MOM_QOps@mom.gov.sg as a declaration before doing so.

If MOM staff checks in with them via phone/video call, your foreign employees would need to show this documentation (i.e. email of declaration to QOps) to explain why they were found outside their residential premises during the SHN period.

When moving house, your foreign employees are required to wear a mask at all times, minimise contact with others and practise safe distancing measures. Once the move is completed, employers will have to update their foreign employees’ addresses on <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/feedbackshn" target="_blank">https://www.mom.gov.sg/feedbackshn</a>, as well as on Online Foreign Worker Address Service (for Work Permit holders) or Employment Pass (EP) Online (for S Pass holders).

#### **28. Can I relocate my employee to another housing, as he is staying in a residence with many other foreign employees?**
Employers are not permitted to move their foreign employees to another residence unless the Ministry of Manpower instructs you to do so. This is effective as of 18 April 2020, the date of the advisory release.
