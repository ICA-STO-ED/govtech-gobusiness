#### **1. What constitutes a business event?**
Business events are Business-to-business (B2B) events which refer to meetings, functions, conferences and other business-oriented events.

#### **2. When will business events be allowed to resume? Can I apply to do so?**
Starting from August 2020, STB will be working with the industry to trial Business-to-Business (B2B) events to test the Safe Business Event Risk Management framework and a set of strict Safe Management Measures (SMMs). This will allow STB to further refine the framework with industry feedback and learnings from the pilot events, before the general resumption of B2B events is allowed.

The B2B events sector will need to start by reopening in a phased and calibrated manner. STB’s key priority is to ensure that business events can provide a safe and fruitful experience for event organisers and delegates. We will continue to monitor developments in the global and local COVID-19 situation to determine the appropriate timelines for when other business events can resume. The resumption of businesses in the MICE sector is also dependent on the success of the pilot events and the ability and readiness of the event owners and organisers to implement these measures.

#### **3. What will happen if EOs fail to comply with the framework, is it an offence?**
Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. Further, other levers under the Act, such as closure of the premises, may be used against attractions that are found to be non-compliant.

Businesses that do not comply with the Government’s required SMMs may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance.

#### **4. Why are business events up to 50 pax allowed when national SMMs state that the maximum allowable number is 5 pax in a social gathering?**
The number of individuals allowed for pilot business events is in line with current permissible limits for classes and professional training provided by permitted enterprises, which is set at a maximum of 50 individuals. Business-to-Business (B2B) events will also have to comply with a set of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and an outcome-based approach for the resumption of B2B events in a safe and controlled manner. 

In order to ensure that B2B events are piloted in a safe and controlled manner, STB will be instituting additional measures including further dividing the cohort of 50 individuals into sub-groups of up to 20 individuals each, with no inter-mingling between the sub-groups. In addition, all individuals must continue to maintain at least 1m spacing between individuals at all times, even within each sub-group. This is even more stringent than the current limit of five people for social gatherings, where the one-metre safe distancing requirement is not required.

These stringent set of measures are included as part of the Safe Business Event Risk Management Framework. As part of this framework, Event Organisers and Venues must also demonstrate that they are capable of meeting all the 5 outcomes required for safe resumption of events, which are:
a) Infection control measures for every stage of an event attendee’s journey (pre-to post-event)<br>
b) Limits on crowd density<br>
c) Limits on close contacts between individuals<br>
d) Ensuring a safe and clean environment<br>
e) Preparing for emergencies relating to COVID-19<br>
