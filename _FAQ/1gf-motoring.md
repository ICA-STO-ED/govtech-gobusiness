#### **1. What kind of vehicle/ motor services are allowed during the circuit breaker period?**
Vehicle workshops that provide vehicle recovery and repair services for emergency cases will be allowed to continue operating. This is necessary to ensure that essential firms and workers in essential services who rely on their vehicles for transport and delivery are able to have their vehicles recovered and repaired in the event of a breakdown, accident or other emergency. Vehicle workshops that continue to operate should submit details on their operations and manpower requirements at <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg</a> as soon as possible for review.

Vehicle workshops are not permitted to provide regular servicing and cosmetic-related repairs that are not emergency vehicle services.

Businesses that are allowed to remain open must implement enhanced safe distancing measures to reduce physical interactions. We urge all businesses to play their part in the fight against COVID-19.

#### **2. Are car rental services (including traditional rental car and shared car) allowed to operate during the circuit breaker period?**
Private hire vehicles such as Grab and Go-Jek are allowed to operate as they are providing essential transport services. Drivers are required to wear a mask when conveying passengers. Passengers are also reminded that it is mandatory for them to wear a mask when they leave their homes. Drivers can decline to convey passengers who do not wear a mask during this period.

#### **3. Can car-pooling services continue during the circuit breaker period?**
Car-pooling services including GrabHitch and RydePool are not “essential services”. 
Drivers operating such services must stop providing car-pool services. This includes non-commercial car-pool arrangements between people who do not live in the same residence.
