## **<ins>General Safe Management Measures</ins>**

#### **1. How many persons can I have at my solemnization ceremony?**
You may have up to 10 persons for solemnizations in homes, in ROM(M) Building, or at designated area(s) in the National Museum of Singapore, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization.

In other external solemnization venues, such as places of worship or hotels, you may have up to 50 attendees at your solemnization ceremony, or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. This attendance limit excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization. Please check with your solemnization venue owner / operator on the number of attendees allowed and any other conditions to be met before making arrangements. 

#### **2. Are vendors (e.g. photographers, videographers, make-up artists, bridal studio) allowed to resume operations for solemnizations? Are they part of the guest limit?**
Vendors engaged should be on MTI’s permitted list of activities as reflected on the GoBusiness portal and should have made their manpower declarations to MTI within two weeks of resuming operations. Vendors who are allowed to resume operations for your solemnization can be excluded from the guest limit for your solemnization / reception but should be kept to a minimum.

#### **3. Does the guest limit for in-person solemnizations include the interpreter?**
No, the guest limit excludes the interpreter, Licensed Solemnizer, and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization.

#### **4. Do we need to practise safe distancing and safe management during the solemnization?**
Yes, safe management measures must be in place for the solemnizations. 

For solemnizations held at home, the ROM Building and designated areas in the National Museum of Singapore, up to 10 persons can attend, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization.

For solemnizations held at other venues, couples can have up to 50 persons, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization. If couples have more than 20 guests, attendees should be split into a designated core “wedding party” comprising up to 20 persons (including the bride and groom, and the 2 witnesses), and groups of up to five people for the remaining guests. The “wedding party” should maintain a 1 metre distance from the smaller groups of five. The groups of five should not intermingle or mix, and should also maintain 1 metre distance from each other. 

All attendees should also check their temperature and that they are feeling well before they attend your solemnization. For contact tracing purposes, the wedding couple should inform your Licensed Solemnizer of the names of the attendees, and keep the attendance record for 14 days after your solemnization. For solemnizations in external venues (i.e. besides home and ROM/M), all guests should also check in and out via SafeEntry, and download and activate the TraceTogether app before attending the solemnization.

#### **5. Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnization ceremony? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking?**
The bride and groom may use face masks or face shields throughout the solemnization process. In addition, they may remove their masks and/or face shields for key moments of the solemnization, which includes the exchanging of vows, rings, and to kiss. However, the bride and groom should maintain a 2-metre distance from the rest of the attendees of the solemnization whenever masks and face shields have been removed. All other attendees should have their masks on throughout the solemnization process[^1]. 

Masks / face shields may be removed briefly for photo-taking, but should be put on immediately after photos.

#### **6. How long can our solemnization ceremony last?**
For the safety of the bride, groom, and guests, the solemnization should be kept as brief as possible.

#### **7. Will these measures, including the limit on the number of people, change in the future?**
These guidelines are based on the current situation, and take effect from 4 Aug 2020. The guidelines may change, depending on the COVID-19 situation at that point in time.

You may wish to refer here for updates on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

## **<ins>Solemnizations in homes</ins>**

#### **8. Can we hold our solemnization at home? What are the safe management measures that we must follow?**
Yes, you may hold your solemnization at home, involving up to 10 persons, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter, and any other vendors (kept to a minimum). These 10 persons may include guests who are not immediate family members. 

For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	All guests should wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, and to kiss. Other guests should maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. The bride, groom, and guests may remove their masks briefly for photo-taking. 
- b.	Maintain a safe distance from those from a different household.
- c.	You must also declare to your Licensed Solemnizer the guest list at least 1 day before the solemnization. 

We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All attendees should check their temperature and ensure they are feeling well before they attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  
 
The organiser is responsible for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures[^2].

#### **9. Can I have a small wedding reception at home immediately after my solemnization? Can I perform other cultural rites in the home before or after the solemnization?**
Receptions are not allowed in your home. Couples may want to consider having a separate reception (see Q.19) at allowed venues where proper safe management measures can be observed more readily. Any other pre- or post-solemnization activities held at home should abide by the prevailing number of visitors allowed for home visits.

## **<ins>Solemnizations in the ROM(M) Building and other locations ROM is operating out of</ins>**

#### **10. What are the safe management measures that we must follow for solemnization in the ROM(M) Building and the designated area(s) at the National Museum of Singapore?**
Up to 10 persons may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter (if any), and any other vendors (which should be kept to a minimum). These 10 persons may include guests who are not immediate family members. 

For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	All guests should wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, and kiss. Other guests should maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. Masks may be removed briefly for photo-taking, and should be put on immediately after.
- b.	You will be required to check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises.

The organiser is responsible for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures. 

#### **11. Can I have a small wedding reception at ROM(M) Building after my solemnization? Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony before or after the solemnization at ROM(M) Building?**
No, receptions and other activities outside of the solemnization are not permitted in the ROM(M) Building or designated areas in the National Museum of Singapore operated by ROM.

#### **12. Can I have more than 10 people for my home solemnization, if my house is sufficiently large to accommodate everybody safely?**
We recognise that your solemnization is an important event for you and your family. However, we are also mindful that due to the intimate nature of solemnizations in the home context, there will likely be high level of chances of interaction. Unlike external venues, there will also be no premise staff to support you in implementing the safe management measures. All these pose greater risks to you, your family, and guests, especially any vulnerable groups who may be present. Hence, the cap for home solemnizations remains at 10 persons.

## **<ins>Solemnizations in Places of Worship</ins>**

#### **13. Can we hold our solemnization at Places of Worship? What are the safe management measures that we must follow?**
Up to 50 persons (subject to the safe capacity of the venue) may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, religious and supporting workers, and vendors (which should be kept to a minimum). 

For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	For solemnizations with more than 20 attendees, attendees should be split into a group of 20 (called the “wedding party”), and groups of 5. The “wedding party” should maintain a 1-metre distance from the smaller groups of 5. The groups of 5 should also maintain a 1-metre distance from each other. 
- b.	All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnization.

- c.	Masks/ face shields may be removed momentarily for photo-taking, and should be put on immediately after.

#### **14. Can the solemnization be accompanied by a religious service or rite?**
Yes, your solemnization may be accompanied by a religious service or rite. However, for the safety of yourself and your attendees, this should be kept as short as possible.

#### **17. What are the safe management measures that we must follow for solemnizations outside of the home / the ROM(M) Building?**
Up to 50 persons, or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower, may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter, and any other vendors (kept to a minimum).

## **<ins>Other wedding activities</ins>**

#### **20. Can I hold a reception? How many receptions can I hold? What are the guidelines for receptions?**
You can have only one reception, held on the same day as the solemnization or on a separate day . You may hold your reception in any controlled premises opened for operation (outside of the home, the ROM(M) Building and designated areas in the National Museum of Singapore operated by ROM) that can accommodate receptions whereby safe management measures are implemented and enforced. You may check directly with the venue operator on their processes and conditions for the holding of the reception. Venue owners/ operators may determine if and when to allow solemnizations and receptions to be held in their premises, and may set additional conditions for their use, such as setting a lower limit for attendance based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

For such receptions, you may have up to 50 persons, or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. For the safety of all who are attending your reception, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	For solemnizations and receptions with more than 20 attendees, attendees should be split into a group of 20 (called the “wedding party”), and groups of 5.

#### **28. Must the 50 people in the solemnization and reception be the same?**

#### **29. If we opt for solemnization via video link, can the bride, groom, witnesses and guests be in the same venue? Is there a limit to the number of guests in the same venue?**
The bride, groom, and witnesses can be in the same location if they belong to the same household. If the solemnization is held in the home, then in line with the safe distancing measures, you should not have more than 5 visitors in your home.
