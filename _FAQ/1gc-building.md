## **<ins>Restart of the Construction Sector from 2 June</ins>**

#### **1. I had earlier obtained MTI’s approval to perform essential services during the Circuit Breaker period. Do I need to apply to BCA to continue these works from 2 Jun (inclusive) onwards?**
Companies previously approved by MTI during the Circuit Breaker to carry out essential site activities as indicated in Annex A of BCA’s Advisory dated 2 May 2020 at construction projects (e.g. Qualified Persons (QPs) and any personnel for maintaining site safety, performing vector control, instrumentation and monitoring) and other types of Construction Account Works (refer to Table 2 of BCA’s Advisory dated 25 May 2020) are required to make the necessary submission to BCA and have their employees (both locals and foreigners) tested for COVID-19 by 15 June 2020, failing which the companies will not be allowed to deploy their employees beyond 15 June 2020.

Companies previously approved by MTI to carry out essential site activities can make their submission to BCA at [https://go.gov.sg/bca-essential-site-activities](https://go.gov.sg/bca-essential-site-activities){:target="_blank"} for all personnel (incl. SC/PR/EP/SP/WPH) carrying out these essential site activities by 15 June 2020, failing which companies are not allowed to carry out essential services at sites beyond 15 June 2020.

#### **2. How do I check if my construction project or DfMA factory/ready-mixed concrete plant/sand and aggregate terminal (Supply Works Premises) can resume works?**
BCA will identify selected Construction Projects and Supply Works for resumption of work on 2 June 2020, and notify the respective project owners and owners of Supply Works Premises of the application process by 27 May 2020. Project owners and owners of Supply Works Premises that have not received any notification from BCA by 27 May 2020 will be scheduled to resume work at a later date. 

As per BCA’s advisory dated 27 May 2020, for building works for single dwelling landed properties (those that require building plan submission) that had commenced prior to 7 April 2020 and had been suspended during Circuit Breaker, companies can proceed to submit their applications to restart via [https://go.gov.sg/bca-construction-supply ](https://go.gov.sg/bca-construction-supply){:target="_blank"} to obtain BCA’s approval before works can resume from 2 June 2020. Please refer to BCA’s advisory dated 27 May, Table 3 for the application process, documents and criteria. The full listing and details of the COVID-Safe Restart Criteria may be downloaded on BCA’s website at [https://go.gov.sg/bca-restart-criteria](https://go.gov.sg/bca-restart-criteria){:target="_blank"}.

#### **3. Who is supposed to apply to BCA for approval?**
For Construction Projects, a joint application form endorsed by the Developer and Main Contractor should be submitted through the Main Contractor of the construction project applying to BCA for the approval to restart. For joint arrangement of main contractors (e.g. Consortium, Joint Venture, etc.), all parties shall collaborate and jointly submit one application. The Main Contractor should also consolidate the information for all works performed by all subcontractors and submit in one application.

The application by the Main Contractor should also include all personnel involved in the Construction Project (e.g. Project Managers, RE/RTO/Qualified Person(s) for site supervision). Short term visitors (e.g. delivery personnel) to the site should also be included in the application as far as practicably possible. 

For Supply Works carried out in Supply Works Premises, the owner should be the party to apply to BCA for approval before works in these factories can restart. The application by the owner should include information of all works performed by the subcontractors at the Supply Works Premises, as well all personnel involved in the Supply Works (e.g. Project Managers, RE/RTO/Qualified Person(s) for supervision). Short term visitors (e.g. delivery personnel) to the Supply Works Premises should be included in the application as far as practicably possible. The full listing and details of the COVID-Safe Restart Criteria may be downloaded on BCA’s website at [https://go.gov.sg/bca-restart-criteria](https://go.gov.sg/bca-restart-criteria){:target="_blank"}.

For Construction Account Works, the Business Owner carrying out these works should be the party to apply to BCA with details on their construction account workers.

#### **4. Why was my contractor unable to successfully apply for restart, even after being informed of our eligibility to apply for restart under the current phase?**
The granting of approval to resume works is dependent on fulfilling all aspects of the COVID-Safe Restart Criteria. As such, plans submitted shall be comprehensive, addressing all stipulated requirements to ensure a COVID-safe working environment for all project parties. We seek the cooperation of applicants to refrain from submitting multiple duplicate applications as these may overload the system and lengthen processing time. Duplicate applications will be rejected.

#### **5. I want to start on building works that does not require a permit from BCA (i.e. Insignificant Building Works). Do I need to apply to BCA to commence these works?**
Yes. For insignificant building works (IBW) within a Construction Project site (with e-Corenet Project reference number.), these works should be applied to start under the Main Contractor’s application to Restart for the whole Construction Project. 
For insignificant building works performed outside a construction project, companies are to make an application on a later date (details to be given at a later date).

#### **6. I have already obtained BCA’s approval to resume works at one of my projects/Supply Works Premises. Will I be able to proceed with works on all my projects/DfMA factories?**
No. For construction projects, the approval granted by BCA to resume works is project specific. 

Similarly, for supply works, the approval granted by BCA to resume works is    also specific to each Supply Works Premise. 

For essential site activities as indicated in Annex A of <a href="https://go.gov.sg/bca-advisory-construction-industry" target="_blank">BCA Advisory dated 2 May 2020</a> (e.g. site maintenance, site safety, vector control, instrumentation & monitoring), the approval will be specific to the project locations and works indicated in the approval granted by BCA. 

For construction account works, BCA approval is required before the deployment of construction account workers.

#### **7. I am constructing on-site living quarters for my site but not starting other parts of the project, do I need to obtain BCA’s approval first before constructing the on-site quarters?**
Yes. Construction of on-site quarters alone without starting other parts of the project would also need BCA’s approval to start work from 2 June 2020, similar to any other construction project. You will also need to apply for the necessary permits with the relevant agencies. For more information on MOM’s requirements for housing please visit: [https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing){:target="_blank"}.

#### **8. Can preparation works like cable detection, trial trenching, hoarding works for new Construction Projects be carried out from 2 June 2020 onwards, or do the requirements for Construction Projects have to be fully complied with?**
All preparation works such as cable detection, trial trenching, hoarding works must seek approval from BCA similar to starting of any other construction work and comply with the COVID-Safe Restart Criteria.

#### **9. My company had received approval from BCA to restart construction account works with some workers after 2 June 2020. Do I need to inform BCA of additional manpower that I plan to deploy?**
Companies that had received approval from BCA to restart construction account works with some workers and now wish to deploy additional workers who are construction work permit or S-pass holders before deployment, will need to seek BCA’s approval again for these additional workers. 

Companies carrying out construction account works must ensure compliance with COVID-Safe Workforce and COVID-Safe Worker Accommodation and Transport Restart Criteria for the construction Work Permit and S Pass holders that they employ, as well as prevailing requirements from MOM. All workers are also required to attend training to be familiarised with COVID safe management measures before restarting work. More details are available at [https://www.bcaa.edu.sg/BESafe](https://www.bcaa.edu.sg/BESafe){:target="_blank"}.

#### **10a. From 2 June 2020, what must I do to resume work in my HQ office, outside of construction sites/renovation sites, using my employees who are not construction sector WP or S-pass holders (i.e. SC/PR, EP, non-construction sector WP/S-pass)?**

#### **10b. From 2 June 2020, can I provide essential services (e.g. maintenance of equipment, repairs & rectifications, delivery/ receiving of materials) using my employees who are not construction sector WP or S-pass holders (i.e. SC/PR, EP, non-construction sector WP/S-pass)?**
Resumption of administrative works in corporate offices, works on non-construction/renovation sites and essential services (e.g. maintenance of equipment, repairs & rectifications, delivery/receiving of materials) do not require approval from BCA so long as such works do not deploy construction account work permit holders (WPHs) and S-pass holders. Nonetheless, telecommuting should be adopted to the maximum extent feasible. Those who have been working from home so far should continue to do so. 

From 2 Jun,  companies that do not already have a General Exemption from MTI must apply and obtain MTI’s approval for a general or time-limited exemption at [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}.

#### **11. Do I have to include the details of part-time site personnel in my application to resume Construction Projects/Supply Works Premises?**
Yes, all personnel involved in the Construction Project/Supply Works (part-time or full-time) should be included in your application. In the application form, under the “Construction and Supply Main Submission” section, you may fill in the excel form with details of all personnel involved in the Construction Project/Supply Works and indicate if the personnel is working full-time or part-time on site or in the Supply Works Premise. Qualified Persons and site supervisors such as REs and RTOs should also be included in the application.

#### **12. Is there a limit on the number of workers in my application to resume building works for landed residential properties (single dwelling unit)?**
Yes, up to 10 workers will be allowed for each application to resume building works for landed residential properties (single dwelling unit). If you wish to replace any of the workers that were earlier approved to work on the project, please re-submit your application to resume building works and quote your earlier approved application number.

## **<ins>Resumption of Suspended Renovation Works and Building Works for Landed Residential Properties (Single Dwelling Unit)</ins>**

#### **1a. How would I know if my company needs to seek approval from BCA before restarting renovation works?**

#### **1b. My company only employs Singaporeans and Permanent residents. Do I need to seek BCA’s approval before restarting renovation work?**

#### **1c. My company is not registered under the construction sector and I do not have construction sector workers. Does my company still need to submit an application to BCA to resume renovation works?**
All companies performing renovation works and intending to resume previously suspended renovation works, are required to seek approval from BCA before deploying their workers. This also applies if the company only employs Singaporeans and Permanent residents.

#### **2. Does my company need to apply with MTI to resume work, on top of the approval that BCA has given before we restart renovation works?**
Companies would need to seek approval from BCA who is approving on behalf of MTI, to resume work. After which, the company’s approval to resume work will be reflected on MTI's website. Companies that are restarting previously suspended renovation works in HDB residential units will need to log into HDB’s Application for Renovation Permit via Electronic Transaction (APEX) system to apply to change the dates for the renovation works as the dates in their earlier application would have lapsed.

#### **3. I need to go down to the site to take photos and measurements before submitting the application. Do I need to get any approval from BCA?**
No, there is no need to seek BCA’s approval if you are not starting work on site.

#### **4. How long does it take to obtain approval for my application?**
If all the documents submitted are in order, BCA aims to give the approval in 3 working days.

#### **5. My company had received approval from BCA to restart works with some workers after 2 June. Do I need to inform BCA of additional manpower that I plan to deploy?**
Companies that had received approval from BCA to restart works with some workers and now wish to deploy additional workers who are construction work permit, S-pass or employment pass holders before deployment, will need to seek BCA’s approval again for these additional workers.

Companies must ensure compliance with COVID-Safe Workforce and COVID-Safe Worker Accommodation and Transport Restart Criteria for the construction Work Permit or S Pass holders that they employ, as well as prevailing requirements from MOM. All workers who are carrying out renovation works are also required to attend training to be familiarised with COVID safe management measures before restarting work. More details are available at [https://www.bcaa.edu.sg/BESafe](https://www.bcaa.edu.sg/BESafe){:target="_blank"}.

#### **6a. Which works would not be allowed to resume from 2 June 2020 onwards?**
#### **6b. When can we apply to start new renovation works? Can we appeal to start new renovation works earlier?**
#### **6c. Will renovations in commercial properties be allowed to restart?**
Only previously suspended residential renovation works can resume from 2 June. 
Suspended non-residential renovation works and new renovation projects are expected to start in the next phase. However, the timing of when new projects may be able to start ultimately depends on the COVID-19 situation, as we all play our part to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission even with some works resuming. BCA will provide monthly updates on when new renovation works can resume.

#### **7. What are the types of renovation works that can resume and require approval from BCA?**
All companies carrying out renovation works will need to seek BCA’s approval before they can resume works. Previously suspended residential renovation works that commenced prior to 7 April 2020 will be prioritised to enable early occupation of the unit. Renovation works refer to independent building finishing works, which are not part of a construction project that requires a permit from BCA. **Suspended renovation works in non-residential premises, and new renovation works will only be allowed to commence at a later date.**

Please refer to Table 1 of the advisory for examples of renovation works: [https://go.gov.sg/bca-advisory-restart-residential-reno-bldg-works](https://go.gov.sg/bca-advisory-restart-residential-reno-bldg-works){:target="_blank"}.

#### **8. If my company has various renovation projects, do I submit 1 application for all the projects or do I have to make an application for each project?**
Details of the renovation projects can be submitted in one application. However, only projects that have been suspended due to the circuit breaker period may be included in the application to restart works. **Please do not submit projects which have not yet commenced work in the application.**

#### **9. I own an interior design (ID) company, and do not do any physical works on-site as these are all done by sub-contractors. Do I need to submit an application to BCA for approval to start work?**
If you (the Interior designer) wish to go to the renovation site, you will need to submit an application under [https://go.gov.sg/bca-reno-construction-accounts](https://go.gov.sg/bca-reno-construction-accounts){:target="_blank"}. Each of your sub-contractors will also need to submit their own application with detailed information of their own workers.

#### **10. Do renovation contractors need to reapply to HDB for a permit to resume previously suspended renovation works at HDB units?**
Renovation applications that were approved by HDB before the Circuit Breaker period do not need to be re-submitted to HDB for approval. However, contractors would need to log in to HDB’s Application for Renovation Permit via Electronic Transaction (APEX) system to apply to change the dates for the renovation works as the dates in their earlier application would have lapsed. Upon submitting a copy of BCA’s approval, contractors will be given the option to change the dates in the system.

#### **11. For renovations which are partially done and tenants/owners are staying in the house, would any additional rules apply?**
Workers are required to adhere to Safe Distancing Measures at all times, regardless of whether there are tenants in the house.

#### **12. Can renovation companies deploy both local and foreign workers to the same renovation project?**
Yes. However, companies must obtain approval from BCA before restarting works. Companies must ensure that workers holding construction work permits or S-pass comply with COVID-Safe Workforce and COVID-Safe Worker Accommodation and Transport Restart Criteria. All workers who are construction Work Permit and S Pass holders and are carrying out renovation works are also required to attend training to be familiarised with COVID safe management measures before restarting work. More details are available at [https://www.bcaa.edu.sg/BESafe](https://www.bcaa.edu.sg/BESafe){:target="_blank"}.

In addition, companies must comply with the Ministry of Manpower’s safe management measures at workplaces after Circuit Breaker period as detailed in MOM’s advisory at  [https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}.

#### **13. My appeal to resume renovation works has been rejected. What can I do?**
For a safe and controlled restart to minimise the risk of resurgence of COVID-19, it is important that renovation companies are able to comply with BCA’s COVID-Safe Workforce and Accommodation and Transport. These are the baseline requirements that must be satisfied before BCA would consider if suspended renovation works are allowed to resume. Homeowners/Business owners should also do their part to make sure that the companies they engage for their renovation works have complied with COVID-Safe Workforce and COVID-Safe Worker Accommodation/Transport Restart Criteria.
