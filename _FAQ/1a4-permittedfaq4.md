#### **1. Can insurance agents physically meet clients from 2 June onwards?**
Insurance agents are not permitted to have face-to-face meetings with clients, except where clients’ physical presence is legally required to complete transactions.  In such situations, the meeting must take place in the office of the insurer.

#### **2. Are property agents allowed to meet and bring clients to view properties from 2 June onwards?**
Property agents are not permitted to have direct, face-to-face meetings with clients. However, should your client’s physical presence be legally required to complete the transaction, your client may complete the transaction at the lawyer’s or HDB’s office. If this is not possible, you should arrange for the completion of the transaction in your property agency’s office with the necessary safe management measures as required by MOM.

#### **3. Can MTI allow potential tenants to physically view vacant property units from 2 June onwards?**
As we exit the circuit breaker period on 2 June, we will embark on a phased approach to resume activities safely. Given that the risk of a resurgence in community transmission remains high, we will first resume economic activities that pose a lower risk of transmission and involve little or no interaction with the wider community.

In light of these considerations, Real Estate Salespersons (RESs) should continue to avoid activities involving direct, face-to-face interactions with any other persons in Phase 1. For instance, activities such as physical viewings, which involve contact with different groups of people such as landlords and potential tenants are not permitted. However, RESs are able to continue to conduct property viewings through electronic means which some have been doing throughout the circuit breaker period.

Agents may enter the property on their own to photograph or film the property if the property is unoccupied, to facilitate online viewings thereafter. Agents should not enter occupied properties, even if it is temporarily vacated, to photograph or film the property.

We will continue to closely monitor the health situation in Singapore after we exit the circuit breaker period. If community transmission rates remain low and stable over the subsequent few weeks, we will be able to move into Phase Two and gradually resume more activities.

#### **10. Given that in-person marriage solemnisations are allowed to take place in Phase 1, are wedding- related services such as wedding photography, videography and make-up services, allowed to resume as well? Are venues which are currently not in operation allowed to re-open for the purposes of wedding solemnisation?**
No. Wedding-related services are not allowed to resume operations in Phase 1 until further notice. They may continue to sell their products online and fulfil the orders through delivery.

Venues which are currently not in operation are not allowed to re-open for the purposes of wedding solemnisation. This includes hotels which remain open for the purpose of supporting SHN, GQF, CIF and accommodation needs of employees in the healthcare sector and foreigners affected by travel restrictions as well as restaurants which are only open for takeaway and delivery during this period. 

#### **11. Can I fix an appointment to repair my leaking air conditioner? What safe distancing measures must all repair personnel abide by?**
You may fix an appointment to repair your air conditioner. The repair of consumer electronics, IT peripherals, and household appliances is allowed to continue during the circuit breaker period. Air con servicing will also be allowed to resume from 2 June onwards.

All repair personnel must comply with stringent hygiene and safe distancing practices. These include wearing a mask, minimising physical contact and interaction, and maintaining a safe distance as much as possible. The number of personnel should also be kept to a minimum and they must leave the premises once the job is completed.
