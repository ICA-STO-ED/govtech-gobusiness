#### **1. Do religious organisations (ROs) still need to apply to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) for a Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) prior to returning on-site to complete administrative tasks?**
No, ROs no longer have to apply for a TLE.
- In Phase Two, ROs can resume their workplace activities at their registered premises. 
- Telecommuting must remain the default where feasible, so as to minimise the number of on-site religious workers and staff. 
- There should be no cross-deployment or interaction between workers in different shifts, teams or worksites, even outside of work. If cross-deployment cannot be avoided (e.g. due to the nature of the job), additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross-infection (e.g. systems are in place to ensure no direct contact with the cross-deployed personnel). 
- Religious workers and staff on-site must comply with safe distancing and other prevailing workplace safe management measures stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

#### **2. I have submitted Safe Management Plans for my religious organisation (RO) during Phase One. Do I need to submit another plan for Phase Two?**
Yes. As Phase Two involves the gradual resumption of congregational and worship services, as well as other non-congregational worship activities, all ROs are required to submit their Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before resumption of Phase Two activities. ROs who have already submitted their safe management plan in Phase One only need to submit a shorter plan to cover the additional safe management measures for Phase Two activities. Please refer to <a href="www.cpro.gov.sg" target="_blank">www.cpro.gov.sg</a> for details.

ROs requesting deviations from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities.

MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations. 

#### **3. My religious organisation (RO) was not open during Phase One and I did not submit my Phase One Safe Management Plans. Am I allowed to proceed with Phase Two activities?**
- Your RO has to submit a Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before commencing Phase Two activities. 
- ROs who wish to deviate from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities. 
- MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations.

#### **4. Are entertainment venues (e.g. public entertainment venues, cinemas, theatres and attractions) allowed to resume operations from 19 June onwards?**
No, these venues will resume operations progressively, later in Phase Two. These venues and activities typically involve large numbers of people interacting with one another, often in enclosed spaces, and for prolonged periods of time, with the potential to spawn large clusters of infected persons.  The relevant agencies will be engaging the operators of these venues on the safe management measures required to manage the risks involved, and will advise them on the approval processes and timelines for the resumption of their operations. 

Operators may wish to refer to sector-specific updates on this website, or visit the following agencies’ website for the latest updates:

#### **5. Why are commercial cue sports outlets not able to resume operations yet?**
Commercial cue sports outlets (i.e. billiard saloons) are considered entertainment venues. The resumption of operations at entertainment venues will be more gradual, as the activities in these settings typically involve large numbers of people coming into close contact, often in enclosed spaces, and for prolonged periods of time, with the potential to spawn large clusters of COVID-19 infections.

SPF has begun to engage billiard saloon operators on the possible safe management measures to be implemented for their operations to resume safely, and will consider operators’ feedback. When the safe management measures have been finalised, SPF will then notify operators of the date when they can resume their operations, subject to the implementation of the safe management measures. Operators can refer to SPF’s <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/e-services/police-licences/public-entertainment-licence" target="_blank">website</a> for the latest information.

#### **6. Can performing arts resume their rehearsals? Is there a limit to the number of persons allowed during rehearsals?**
Rehearsals will be allowed to resume, subject to limits on involvement and organisations/practitioners’ ability and readiness to adhere to safe management measures. These would be indicated in NAC’s upcoming advisory for the arts and culture sector.

#### **7. Are there any restrictions for dining in at F&B outlets from 19 June 2020 onwards?**
Yes. There should be a one metre distance between distinct groups of not more than five persons, with no mixing between groups. Other safe management measures should also be in place.

#### **8. What are some of the personal health and wellness services that may reopen in Phase Two?**
Some of the personal health and wellness services that may reopen include spas, massage centres, fitness studios, gyms and sports facilities.

#### **9. Are car showrooms allowed to reopen in Phase Two?**
Yes. Car showrooms may reopen from 19 June 2020.

#### **10. Country clubs are allowed to open in Phase Two. Are all facilities within the country club allowed to open from 19 June 2020?**
No. While country clubs are allowed to resume operations from 19 June 2020, facilities such as karaoke rooms, cinema/movie rooms and billiard halls within the club must remain closed.

#### **11. When will events be allowed to resume?**
Activities or settings where large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces and for prolonged periods of time, are still not allowed to resume in Phase Two as these settings can spawn large clusters of infections, given the number of close contacts between individuals during the course of such activities.

STB has begun to engage relevant businesses and organisations on possible safe management measures to be taken for these activities or settings. STB will advise businesses and organisations on the approval processes and timelines for resumption at a later date.

#### **12. What are some examples of home-based services which can resume in Phase Two? Do they include home-based cleaners or home-based salons?**
Under Phase Two, home-based services, including those involving visitors to the home, will be allowed to resume, as long as they comply with prevailing rules and safe management measures, including the cap of five visitors allowed in the home at any one time. Service providers are required to wear masks and maintain a one metre distancing.

Home-based services that involve customers entering one's home for a prolonged period e.g. private dining and hairdressing services must deploy SafeEntry.
