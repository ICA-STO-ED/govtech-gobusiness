A summary of the key provisions for businesses are as follows:

<ins>(a) Broad based – Cash flow</ins>

1. Waiver of monthly Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) due in April 2020. 
2. FWL rebate of $750 in April 2020 from levies paid this year for each Work Pemit or S Pass Holder.

5. Govenments’ risk share raised from 80% to 90% for EFS-Trade Loan, EFS-SME Working Capital Loan and Temporary Bridging Loan Programme

<ins>(b) Broad based – Workforce related</ins>

1. The **Jobs Support Scheme (JSS)** has been further enhanced. To help save jobs, the Government will pay 75% on the first $4,600 of monthly salaries for every local employee for Apr 2020. From May 2020, wage support levels will revert to original levels in Resilience Budget.[1] The first JSS payout will be brought forward to April 2020, from May 2020.
    - To encourage firms to retain local workers during this period of uncertainty, the Government will co-fund wages of workers for 9 months in 3 payouts.
      - April 2020 – All sectors (75% wage support)
      - Remaining qualifying months – Aviation & Tourism (75% wage support); Food Services (50% wage support); All other sectors (25% wage support)
      - First payout (Apr 2020); Second payout (Jul 2020); Third payout (Oct 2020).

2. SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS)
    - More  SEPs will qualify for SIRS.
    - Eligible SEPs will reeive three quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each in May, July and October 2020.
    - Other criteria remain unchanged. 

3. To encourage enterprise to continue in their transformation efforts and share the productivity gains with their workers, the Wage Credit Scheme will be enhanced to offer more support in the co-funding of wage increase for Singaporean workers. The scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singapore employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. This will be raised to $5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020.

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill will be introduced to offer temporary relief to businesses and individuals who are unable to fulfil certain contractual obligations because of COVID-19. It will seek to provide temporary cash-flow relief for these businesses and individuals, who may otherwise have to pay damages or risk having their deposits or assets forfeited.

#### **11. If I see a non-essential business continue to operate even though it is not supposed to, what should I do?**
Please report this business and provide relevant details such as its name, address and relevant evidence (e.g. photographs) to Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg

#### **12. What do I do if I am unable to enter the supermarket/F&B outlets due to long queues?**
You may consider food takeaways at other F&B outlets or food/grocery delivery services.

#### **13. Is it safe to use reusable containers for takeaway? What if the container was handled by someone who has the virus?**
According to the Singapore Food Authority, there is currently no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food and food packaging that may have been exposed to an infected person. This means that there is a very low risk of spread from food, product and packaging. Members of the public should continue to practice good hygiene habits such as washing their hands regularly.

#### **14. What are the penalties for non-compliant companies that flout the suspension of activities at workplace premises and safe distancing measures?**
The Government takes a serious view of any infringement of safe distancing measures and will not hesitate to take actions against non-compliant businesses.

Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

#### **15. My house is currently under renovation and I need a place to stay. Where can I find lodging?**
You may consider staying at serviced apartments.

#### **16. How do we identify Safe Distancing Ambassadors from ESG and STB?**
Safe Distancing Ambassadors from ESG and STB will be wearing a lanyard and a red polo shirt with the words “Safe Distancing Ambassador” on the back.

#### **17. I do not agree with the decision of the Safe Distancing Ambassador. What is my recourse?**
The decision of the SDA / enforcement officers is final. Verbal warnings will be issued and if businesses continue to flout the rules, stricter enforcement measures including fines and suspension of operations will be imposed.

#### **18. How do we verify the identity of Enforcement Officers? What do they do? Are we required to pay fines on the spot?**
Enforcement officers from various agencies including the Singapore Police Force, National Environment Agency, National Parks Board and Land Transport Authority, are issued a letter of appointment by the Ministry of Health. They are deployed to enforce safe distancing measures and control order regulations, by conducting compliance inspections during the “circuit breaker” period.

These officers can issue offenders (businesses or individuals) a Notice of Offence, which include the composition fine amount and details of the offence. Offenders will not be asked to pay their fines on the spot. These officers can also issue warning letters to individuals.

#### **19. I am issued a fine and/or a suspension of operations. How do I make an appeal?**
The decision of the Enforcement Officers is final. You are reminded to pay the composition sum by the date indicated in the Notice of Offence and refrain from committing any further offences to comply with the law at all times.

#### **20. I am issued a fine. How do I make payment?**
You can refer to the Notice of Offence issued to you for information on the payment mode. Enforcement officers will not collect fines on the spot, from individuals and businesses who have contravened these rules. The penalties for breaches will be issued to individuals or businesses in the form of composition letters, which will state the relevant follow up actions required.

#### **21. Where can I get more information on the regulatory requirements relating to safe distancing?**
You can refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 on the Singapore Statutes Online website at <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://sso.agc.gov.sg</a>
