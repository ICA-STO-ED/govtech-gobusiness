#### **7. These additional measures have impacted my business greatly. How is the Government supporting us?**
The government has introduced a series of new measures, and enhancements to existing measures, to help enterprises and employees deal with the impact of COVID-19. Some of the relevant measures include: 

<ins>Broad based – Cash flow</ins>
: a. There is a **Corporate Income Tax Rebate** for Year of Assessment 2020, at a rate of 25% of tax payable, capped at $15,000 per company. This rebate will benefit all tax-paying companies. 
: b. To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the **Enterprise Financing Scheme’s SME Working Capital Loan** component will be enhanced for one year. The maximum loan quantum will be raised to $1million, and government’s risk-share on these loans will be increased to 80%.
: c. For 2020, qualifying commercial properties that have been more badly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, including hotels, serviced apartments, shops and restaurants **will pay no Property Tax**. Businesses in other non-residential properties will also receive a **Property Tax Rebate** of 30% for the year 2020. Please note that property owners will be obliged to pass on to their tenants the property tax rebate attributable to the rented property. 

<ins>Broad based – Workforce related</ins>
: a. Under the enhanced **Jobs Support Scheme**, the Government will help employers by paying 25% on the first $4,600 of monthly salaries, for 9 months.
: b. To encourage enterprise to continue in their transformation efforts and share the productivity gains with their workers, the **Wage Credit Scheme** will be enhanced to offer more support in the co-funding of wage increase for Singaporean workers. The scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singapore employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. This will be raised to $5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. 

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill will be introduced to offer temporary relief to businesses and individuals who are unable to fulfil certain contractual obligations because of COVID-19. It will seek to provide temporary cash-flow relief for these businesses and individuals, who may otherwise have to pay damages or risk having their deposits or assets forfeited. Please refer to the MinLaw website for more details.

#### **8. If I see a non-essential business continue to operate even though it is not supposed to, what should I do?**
Please report this business, including providing relevant details such as its name, address and relevant evidence (e.g. photographs) to Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg

#### **9. What do I do if I am unable to enter the supermarket/F&B outlets due to long queues?**
You may consider food takeaways at other F&B outlets or food/grocery delivery services.

#### **10. Is it safe to use reusable containers for takeaway? What if the container was handled by someone who has the virus?**
According to the Singapore Food Authority, there is currently no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food and food packaging that may have been exposed to an infected person. This means that there is a very low risk of spread from food, product and packaging. Members of the public should continue to practice good hygiene habits such as washing their hands regularly.
