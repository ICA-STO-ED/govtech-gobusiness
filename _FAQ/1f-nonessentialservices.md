#### **1. Is my company required to suspend all business activities if my operations cannot continue via telecommuting?**
Permitted  services are exempted from the suspension of on-site business activities. If your company’s business activities do not belong to the permitted services list , but can continue to operate via telecommuting, you may continue to do so. Where possible, businesses are encouraged to adopt video and audio conferencing and other IT tools to support their employees to work from home.

#### **2. If my business is not allowed to resume operation, can I go to my place of business to perform maintenance of the facility, attend to perishable products, receive deliveries or perform other necessary tasks?**
You may go to your business location for a short duration to take care of crucial tasks that cannot be done remotely or to retrieve necessary materials or documents even if your business is not allowed to resume operations.

Your employees are not permitted to go to your place of business. They may work remotely from home.

If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), you need to apply for a time-limited exemption. Please submit your application **one day before** the required date of use.

If you need to maintain a small workforce at your place of business for safety purposes, please apply for a general exemption. 

#### **3. If I see a non-permitted business continue to operate even though it is not supposed to, what should I do?**
Please report this business and provide relevant details such as its name, address and relevant evidence (e.g. photographs) to <a href="mailto:Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg" target="_blank">Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>. 

#### **4. What happens if my company is unable to pay employees’ salaries due to the suspension of activities?**
The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) will help enterprises retain their local employees during this period of uncertainty. All active employers, with the exception of Government organisations (local and foreign) and representative officers, are eligible for the JSS. For more details, please visit the IRAS website at <a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg" target="_blank">http://www.iras.gov.sg</a> or call the hotline 1800 3524728.

#### **5. Should my company continue with medical insurance coverage for foreign employees, given that they are unable to work during the suspension of activities?**
Yes, employers who fail to meet the medical insurance requirement for their foreign employees (WP, S Pass holders and FDW) may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or both. In addition, they may be barred from employing foreign employees. The medical insurance requirement is not applicable to EP holders.

#### **6. Can foreign employees be redeployed to work on areas that are not within their current approved vocations? If so, what are the procedures that companies need to follow?**
Employers can write in to MOM with reasons for the redeployment and seek permission to do so.
