#### **1. Why do I need to submit the details of my essential manpower?**
With the implementation of circuit breaker measures from 7 Apr 2020, only businesses performing essential services and their related supply chains and service providers can continue operating.

All other non-essential businesses will have to suspend their operations, unless they are able to conduct their business through telecommuting, or have received an approval of exemption from the suspension.

As the number of new infection cases continue to rise, stricter measures to control the flow of essential manpower in the workplace must be put in place.

#### **2. How do I know if I need to submit the details of my essential manpower?**
Only businesses that have received an exemption approval and an email notification to submit details of their essential manpower will be required to do so. Businesses will have 2 days from the date they receive the email notification to submit the details of their essential manpower.

If businesses have not received the email notification to submit the details of their essential manpower yet, they can continue to operate based on the earlier approval given.

#### **3. How do I register my essential manpower and what information do I need to provide?**
For applicants with a CorpPass account, please login to <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essentialworkers" target="_blank">here</a>. Thereafter, please click on the button “submit manpower details”, which will be made available only for approved applications, to register the NRIC/FIN numbers of your essential manpower.

For applicants without a CorpPass account, please call the Enterprise Infoline at 6898-1800 to request for a form to be emailed to you. Please submit the completed form to <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>.

Please ensure that your email address is accurately reflected on your application form. An acknowledgement email will be sent to your email address once you have submitted the details of your essential manpower. We will also be using this email address to provide you with updates.

#### **4. When can I start to submit the details of my essential manpower?**
The form for the submission of essential manpower is available <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg" target="_blank">here</a> from 19 April 2020. You will have 2 days from the date that you receive the email notification to do so.

#### **5. Why is the exemption start and end date stated as N/A?**
If you have applied for a general exemption, there will not be an exemption start and end date as the exemption is for the entire circuit breaker period unless you are notified otherwise.

#### **6. I am unable to add in the details of my essential manpower. Why is it so?**
You may only register your essential manpower after your company exemption is approved. Please check your application status at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/exemptionstatus" target="_blank">here</a>. 

#### **7. I have problems adding in more essential manpower details to my application. Why is it so?**
Each business is allotted a specific manpower quota. You will not be able to add more essential employees/workers to your application once you have reached the allotted quota. The cap on the number of workers that you are allowed to have on-site is necessary to minimise the movement of workers to and from work.  We are acutely aware that this will be disruptive for businesses, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19.

#### **8. What happens after I have submitted the details of my essential manpower?**
An acknowledgement email will be sent to your email address to inform you that we have received a record of the details of your essential manpower.

#### **9. What happens if I do not receive an acknowledgement email after I have submitted the  details of my essential manpower?**
If you have not received an acknowledgement email, your email address may be inaccurately captured on our system.

For applicants with a CorpPass account, kindly login <a href="https://go.gov.sg/exemptionstatus" target="_blank">here</a> to verify if your email address is accurately reflected. You will be able to update your email address if needed. All changes will be reflected immediately.

For applicants without a CorpPass account, please call the Enterprise Infoline at 6898-1800 for assistance.

#### **10. What should I do if I would like to make changes to the details of my essential manpower?**
Please login <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essentialworkers" target="_blank">here</a> and click on the approved exemption to resubmit the NRIC/FIN numbers of your essential manpower. Kindly resubmit **<ins>all</ins>** NRIC/FIN numbers of your essential manpower who are working on-site.

#### **11. Is there a limit to the number of times I can change the details of my essential manpower?**
You may change and resubmit the details of your essential manpower  up to 3 times a day.

Kindly resubmit the NRIC/FIN numbers of **<ins>all</ins>** your essential manpower  who are working on-site for each resubmission. The list of essential manpower working on site  will be based on the latest submission.

#### **12. What are the penalties for non-compliant companies that deploy manpower to work on-site without first submitting the details of their essential  manpower?**
The Government takes a serious view of any infringement and will not hesitate to take actions against non-compliant businesses.

Under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 07 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

#### **13. I need more essential manpower on site to ensure the continuation of my business activities. What should I do?**
The cap on the number of essential manpower that you are allowed to have on-site is necessary to minimise the movement of workers to and from work.  We are acutely aware that this will be disruptive for businesses, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19. Each and every one of us can, and must, play our part in protecting our people from infection. If you would, nevertheless, like to request for a review of your cap, please click on <a href="https://go.gov.sg/additionalmanpower" target="_blank">Submission of Additional Manpower</a>.

#### **14. My appeal for additional manpower had already been rejected, but I really need more employees/workers on-site. Can I appeal again?**
Further appeals will not be considered.

#### **15. Can my company register more essential manpower than the permitted headcount on-site given that we operate on a split team basis?**
Please click on <a href="https://go.gov.sg/additionalmanpower" target="_blank">Submission of Additional Manpower</a> to request for a review.

#### **16. Can I continue to operate with more manpower than the headcount stipulated on my “Manpower Submission form”, while I submit an appeal for additional manpower?**
No. Businesses should operate with the allocated headcount shown on the “Manpower Submission” form until they receive an email that their appeal has been approved.

#### **17. I am a sole proprietor and have no employees. I had previously received the approval of my exemption request. Must I submit my personal details via the “Manpower Submission” form?**
Yes. You will still need to submit your details via the form when you receive the notification email to do so.

#### **18. I run an Employment Agency. Would it be my responsibility to register my employees’ details or should companies that hire these contract workers be responsible?**
Employment agencies should register the details of all workers under their direct employment regardless of where they are deployed.
