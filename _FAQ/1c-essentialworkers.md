#### **1. Why do I need to submit my essential employees/workers’ details?**
With the implementation of circuit breaker measures from 7 Apr 2020, only businesses performing essential services and their related supply chains and service providers can continue operating.

All other non-essential businesses will have to suspend their operations, unless they are able to conduct their business through telecommuting, or have received an approval of exemption from the suspension.

As the number of new infection cases continue to rise, stricter measures to control the flow of essential employees/workers in the workplace must be put in place.

#### **2. How do I know if I need to submit my essential employees/workers’ details?**
Only businesses performing essential services and those that have received an approval for exemption will be required to submit details of their essential employees/workers to authorise them to work at their respective work premises.

#### **3. How do I register my essential employees/workers and what information do I need to provide?**

#### **5. Why is the exemption start and end date stated as N/A?**
If you have applied for a general exemption, there will not be an exemption start and end date as the exemption is for the entire circuit breaker period.

An acknowledgement email will be sent to your email address to inform you that we have received a record of your essential employees/workers’ details.

#### **9. I was not in time to submit my essential employee/workers’ details before 10am but I need them to work on-site tomorrow. What should I do to expedite my submission?**
Submissions must be made before 10am every day in order for your essential employees/workers to commence work the next day. Please register your essential employee/workers’ details early.

#### **10. What happens if I do not receive an acknowledgement email after I have submitted the essential employees/workers’ details?**
