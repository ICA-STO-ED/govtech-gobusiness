#### **1. If my employer provides essential services and I am reporting to work, do I need to provide or carry with me any sort of documentation?**
Currently, you are not required to do so. You are encouraged to confirm with your employer that the function you perform is critical and meant to be performed on-site rather than via telecommuting. Employers are encouraged to provide this confirmation to the employee in writing.

#### **2. What happens if my employer operates a non-essential service but insists that I continue working?**
You may report to <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>.

#### **3. Can I go back to my office to pick up personal items?**
All non-essential activities outside the home must be suspended during this period in order to bring the transmission rate down effectively. Please refrain from all non-essential travel to reduce the possibility of transmissions.

#### **4. Can foreign worker levy be waived? Are there any other support measures available for us during this period?**
The Jobs Support Scheme will be further enhanced and foreign worker levies will be waived for April 2020.

#### **5. Should my company continue with medical insurance coverage for foreign employees, given that they are unable to work during the suspension period?**
Yes, employers who fail to meet the medical insurance requirement for their foreign workers (WP, S Pass holders and FDW) may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or both. In addition, they may be barred from employing foreign workers. The medical insurance requirement is not applicable to EP holders.

#### **6. What will happen to my foreign workers since I am not allowed to operate during this period? Can I repatriate my workers since I cannot operate now?**
Instead of repatriation or retrenchment, we urge employers to first consider cost-saving measures to manage excess manpower. E.g. look at training, redeployment, reasonable adjustment of salaries etc. Please take note of MOM’s guidelines on cost saving measures and retrenchment: [https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment){:target="_blank"}

If it is assessed that the foreigner workers are still not needed, employers may give consent for them to be transferred to other employers facing manpower shortages. Employers can approach SBF at <a href = "mailto: manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg">manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg</a> or visit SBF's website.

If foreign workers would like to head home, companies will have to cancel the work passes, repatriate the workers and bear the repatriation cost.

#### **7. Can my employees leave their dormitories during the period of suspension of activities?**
Yes, provided they are not sick and not under Leave of Absence (LOA)/Stay Home Notice (SHN) or Quarantine Orders (QO). 

However, they should only do so for essential activities, such as to get food, health care or commute to their job in an essential service. They should also observe safe distancing measures when they are out. 

#### **8. Can foreign employees be redeployed to work on areas that are not within their current approved vocations? If so, what are the procedures that companies need to follow?**
Employers can write in to the Ministry of Manpower with reasons for the redeployment and seek permission to do so.

#### **9. Is company-based training for essential firms allowed?**
If the company is carrying out essential services and needs to conduct selected face-to-face Continuing Education and Training (CET) for job placement needs or for severely affected economic sectors, the training will be allowed to operate until informed otherwise. The company should submit details of their plans to operate as soon as possible. 

For non-essential firms, training should be conducted online or in e-learning format. 

#### **10. I have been told to ramp up production during this time period but cannot find additional manpower, how do I source for workers during this time?**
MOM has partnered with the Singapore Business Federation to offer a temporary scheme that allows companies in all sectors to hire existing WPHs (who are in Singapore) from other sectors, with the agreement of their current employers. 

Companies can also hire existing WPHs from their own or another sector, where the work permits are within 40 days of expiry. This is an extension of a scheme that exists for the construction and process sectors for transfers within their own sectors. Agreement from the current employer is not needed. 

Hiring firms will be required to meet the prevailing criteria under their respective sectors. This temporary scheme will be in place for five months until 31 August 2020. 

For inter-sectoral transfers (earlier than 40 days before work permit expiry), firms can approach SBF at <a href = "mailto: manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg">manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg</a> or visit their website for more information. For transfer of WPHs from 40 days before work permit expiry (including inter-sectorial transfers), firms can submit their request via an online form or visit MOM’s website for more information.

#### **11. My business is no longer allowed to operate. Do I still need to pay my workers, or should I let them go on leave?**
The Jobs Support Scheme announced by the Government on 6 April is meant to support employers to retain and continue to pay their local employees, even during periods of reduction in business activity.

The Advisory on salary and leave arrangements can be found on the MOM website at <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-salary-and-leave" target="_blank">https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-salary-and-leave</a>

#### **11. What can workers of non-essential firms that have not received the approval to continue operations do, if they are told to leave the company due to refusal to report to work?**
Workers who have been wrongfully dismissed may file a claim against the wrongful dismissal or make a phone advisory appointment with the <a href="https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices" target="_blank">Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)</a>.

For more information on what constitutes a wrongful dismissal, please refer to the Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal.

#### **13. Do statutory medical check-ups, e.g. for foreign domestic workers and work permit holders, medical examination for driving licence, have to be deferred?**
Statutory medical check-ups are considered non-essential and should be deferred. MOH is working with MOM and MOT/LTA for them to notify employers/companies.

#### **14. I need some employees to work at a construction site. Do I need to seek BCA’s approval before I can apply for a time-limited exemption?**
If you are requesting to continue with physical/actual building works on the construction site, you are required to obtain an approval from BCA first at 1800-342-5222 or <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform" target="_blank">www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform</a> before you can proceed.

However, if the work that you will be conducting at the construction site is non-construction related (eg. administrative work done at the office), you do not need to seek BCA’s approval before applying for the Time-Limited Exemption.

#### **15. My company performs essential services and I need to move my workers out of their dormitories (i.e. purpose built dormitories, factory converted dormitories, construction temporary quarters and temporary occupation licence quarters). What can I do?**
You may submit an appeal <a href="https://go.gov.sg/movementpolicyfw" target="_blank">here</a>.
