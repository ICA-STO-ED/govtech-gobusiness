#### **1. What will happen to my foreign employees since I am not allowed to operate during this period? Can I repatriate my employees since I cannot operate now?**
Instead of repatriation or retrenchment, we urge employers to first consider cost-saving measures to manage excess manpower. E.g. look at training, redeployment, reasonable adjustment of salaries etc. Please take note of MOM’s guidelines on cost saving measures and retrenchment: [https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment){:target="_blank"}

If it is assessed that the foreign employees are still not needed, employers may give consent for them to be transferred to other employers facing manpower shortages. Employers can approach SBF at <a href = "mailto: manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg">manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg</a> or visit SBF's website.

If foreign employees would like to head home, companies will have to cancel the work passes, repatriate the employees and bear the repatriation cost.

#### **2. Is company-based training for essential firms allowed?**
Company-based training is only allowed for essential roles to support our national COVID-19 efforts. Companies are reminded to comply with all existing Safe Distancing measures during training.

For non-permitted services firms, training should be conducted online or in e-learning format only.

#### **3. I have been told to ramp up production during this time period but cannot find additional manpower, how do I source for employees during this time?**
MOM has partnered with the Singapore Business Federation to offer a temporary scheme that allows companies in all sectors to hire existing WPHs (who are in Singapore) from other sectors, with the agreement of their current employers. 

Companies can also hire existing WPHs from their own or another sector, where the work permits are within 40 days of expiry. This is an extension of a scheme that exists for the construction and process sectors for transfers within their own sectors. Agreement from the current employer is not needed. 

Hiring firms will be required to meet the prevailing criteria under their respective sectors. This temporary scheme will be in place for five months until 31 August 2020. 

For inter-sectoral transfers (earlier than 40 days before work permit expiry), firms can approach SBF at <a href = "mailto: manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg">manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg</a> or visit their website for more information. For transfer of WPHs from 40 days before work permit expiry (including inter-sectorial transfers), firms can submit their request via an online form or visit MOM’s website for more information.

#### **4. My business is no longer allowed to operate. Do I still need to pay my employees, or should I let them go on leave?**
The Jobs Support Scheme announced by the Government is meant to support employers to retain and continue to pay their local employees, even during periods of reduction in business activity.

The latest Advisory on salary and leave arrangements can be found on the MOM website at <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-salary-and-leave" target="_blank">https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-salary-and-leave</a>

#### **5. What can employees of firms which are not allowed to resume service do, if they are told to leave the company due to refusal to report to work?**
Employees who have been wrongfully dismissed may file a claim against the wrongful dismissal or make a phone advisory appointment with the <a href="https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices" target="_blank">Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)</a>.

For more information on what constitutes a wrongful dismissal, please refer to the <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment/unfair-dismissal#what-is-a-wrongful-dismissal" target="_blank">Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal</a>.

#### **6. Do statutory medical check-ups, e.g. for foreign domestic workers and work permit holders, medical examination for driving licence, have to be deferred?**
Statutory medical check-ups are considered non-essential and should be deferred. MOH is working with MOM and MOT/LTA for them to notify employers/companies.

#### **7. I need some employees to work at a construction site. Do I need to seek BCA’s approval before I can apply for a time-limited exemption?**
If you are requesting to continue with physical/actual building works on the construction site, you are required to obtain an approval from BCA first at 1800-342-5222 or <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform" target="_blank">www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform</a> before you can proceed.

However, if the work that you will be conducting at the construction site is non-construction related (eg. administrative work done at the office), you do not need to seek BCA’s approval before applying for the Time-Limited Exemption.
