#### **1. How do I know if my company is allowed to resume operations from 2 June?**
The list of business activities (and the corresponding Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) codes) that may operate from 2 June 2020 can be found <a href="/permittedlist">here</a>. All businesses that operate are required to comply with the safe management measures <a href="/safemanagement/general/">here</a>.

If you do not know your company’s SSIC code or are unsure of the classification of your business activity, you can visit <a href="https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/">BizFile+</a> and login with your CorpPass to retrieve the SSIC code of your company’s primary business activity. Thereafter, you can check that SSIC code against the list of permitted services that can resume operations on 2 June. 

#### **2. How did MTI decide which companies should resume operations first?**
The objective of Phase 1 is to resume economic and social activities in a safe and gradual manner. Therefore, we will gradually allow more workers to return to work, starting with businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks, or that do not result in large group or close contact. These include manufacturing and production facilities and most businesses with employees working in office settings or settings that do not require interactions with large groups of people. 

However, all employers should ensure that employees whose functions can be done remotely (e.g. by telecommuting) continue to do so.  Employees should only come into the office when demonstrably necessary, e.g. to access specialised systems/equipment that cannot be accessed from home or to complete a transaction that is legally required to be completed in person and on-site. All employers and employees must also adhere to the safe management measures <a href="/safemanagement/general/">here</a> at all times.

In addition, to manage the risks of transmission, most consumer-facing businesses will not be allowed to operate yet. Physical retail stores and services that could lead to social mixing or close contact between individuals (e.g.  cinemas and spas) will not be among the list of businesses that are permitted to operate from 2 June. 

#### **3. Do I need to apply for an exemption to resume operations on 2 June?**
No. Entities whose business is listed in the list of permitted activities need not seek exemption before resuming operations. Taking into consideration the large number of businesses involved, these businesses have been granted a class exemption to resume operations with effect from 2 June 2020, subject to their implementation of safe management measures. However, businesses must submit their manpower details via the GoBusiness portal within 2 weeks of the date of resumption of operations.

Businesses may submit their manpower details using the “Permissions and Manpower Declaration” button on the GoBusiness portal from 26 May onwards.

#### **4. Will I receive an email or document to confirm that my company can resume operations on 2 June?**
No, you will not receive any additional notifications. 

If you are unsure whether you can resume operations, please visit bizfile.gov.sg  and login with your CorpPass to obtain the Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code for your primary business activity. You will be able to retrieve your SSIC code once you have logged in. 

Once you have retrieved your SSIC code for your primary business activity, please check it against the list of permitted services that can resume operations on 2 June here <a href="/permittedlist">here</a>.

#### **5. I had previously received an approval of my General Exemption but my companies’ activities are not listed in the permitted services list. Will I be able to continue operations on 2 June?**
Yes. All companies that received an exemption to operate before 1 June will be able to continue operations.

#### **6. I had previously received an email notification that my exemption had been rescinded, but my company falls under the list of permitted services in Phase 1. Will I be able to resume operations on 2 June?**
Yes. If your company’s business is in the list of permitted services, you will be allowed to resume operations on 2 June. If your company has other business functions or services that are not in the list of permitted services, these other business functions or services should remain suspended until further notice.

#### **7. My company’s activities do not belong to the list of permitted services, but we support a permitted service that is listed. What should I do? Can I appeal?**

#### **23. Will all my staff be allowed to return to office once I resume operations? Do we still need to have split teaming?**
Employers must put in place safe management measures before resuming workplace activities, in order to provide a safe working environment and prevent transmission at the workplace. 

Employers should ensure that employees whose functions can be done remotely (e.g. by telecommuting) continue to do so.  Employees should only come into the office when demonstrably necessary, e.g. to access specialised systems/equipment that cannot be accessed from home or to complete a transaction that is legally required to be completed in person and on-site. All employers and employees must also adhere to the Safe Management Measures <a href="/safemanagement/general/">here</a> at all times. 

If telecommuting is not possible, employers should split their employees into teams. There should be no cross-deployment/interaction between employees in different teams or worksites, even outside of work. 

Strict checks will be conducted, and businesses that do not provide a safe workplace for our workers will be asked to close their workplace again.
