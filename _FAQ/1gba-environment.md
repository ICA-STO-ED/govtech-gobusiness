#### **1. Can I consider servicing cooling towers, swimming pools and water fountains an essential service?**
In view of the heightened safe distancing measures between 7 April to 1 June 2020 (both dates inclusive), all swimming pools, aerosol-generating features of water fountains and cooling towers shall be closed. Only cooling towers serving essential services are allowed to operate. Laboratory tests are not required during this period from 7 April to 1 June 2020 (inclusive) for all regulated water features, including cooling towers serving essential services.

All companies involved in the maintenance of swimming pools, water fountains and cooling towers are required to submit applications to obtain approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) before they are allowed to continue to operate.

From 7 April to 2020 1 June 2020 (inclusive), all such companies that are approved to operate shall adhere to the maximum manpower of 2 staff deployed per site at a frequency of once every 2 weeks when they carry out maintenance of regulated water features, failing which, approvals to continue to operate may be rescinded.

For more guidance on managing water quality in water features, please refer to NEAâ€™s guidelines at this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/neatightenmeasure" target="_blank">link</a>.
