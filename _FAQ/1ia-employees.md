#### **1. My foreign employees were approved as essential workers and they have been working throughout the Circuit Breaker period. Why does the SGWorkPass AccessCode now show a ‘GREY’ status for them? Can they continue to work?**
All companies should check the <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/" target="_blank">GoBusiness Portal</a> to find out if they are allowed to resume operations. If your workers’ AccessCode status is reflected as ‘GREY’ (AccessCode does not apply) even though you are permitted to operate, please approach your respective lead agencies for assistance.

Please also ensure your employees’ residential addresses are updated as it is one of the components that affects the AccessCode status.

#### **2. My foreign employees do not stay in dormitories and are not infected with COVID-19. Why is their SGWorkPass AccessCode status reflected as ‘RED’ when they had been allowed to work and were working during the Circuit Breaker period?**
As the status of your employees’ AccessCode takes into account three broad parameters, it is possible that your employees’ AccessCode is reflected as ‘RED’ if their residential addresses have not been updated with MOM.  As such, please ensure their residential addresses are kept updated.

#### **3. How do I update my foreign employee’s residential address?**
Their residential addresses can be updated through the following eService:
- <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ofwas" target="_blank">Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS)</a> for Work Permit holders
- <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ep-online" target="_blank">EP Online</a> for Employment Pass and S Pass holders 

If their residential addresses have changed, please update their address by 1pm for their AccessCode status to be updated after 2am the next day.

#### **4. What will happen to my foreign employees since I am not allowed to operate during this period? Can I repatriate my employees since I cannot operate now?**
Instead of repatriation or retrenchment, we urge employers to first consider cost-saving measures to manage excess manpower. E.g. look at training, redeployment, reasonable adjustment of salaries etc. Please take note of MOM’s guidelines on cost saving measures and retrenchment: [https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment){:target="_blank"}

If it is assessed that the foreign employees are still not needed, employers may give consent for them to be transferred to other employers facing manpower shortages. Employers can approach SBF at <a href = "mailto: manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg">manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg</a> or visit SBF's website.

If foreign employees would like to head home, companies will have to cancel the work passes, repatriate the employees and bear the repatriation cost.

#### **5. Is company-based training for permitted firms allowed?**
Company-based training is only allowed for essential roles to support our national COVID-19 efforts. Companies are reminded to comply with all existing Safe Distancing measures during training.

For non-permitted services firms, training should be conducted online or in e-learning format only.

#### **6. I have been told to ramp up production during this time period but cannot find additional manpower, how do I source for employees during this time?**
MOM has partnered with the Singapore Business Federation to offer a temporary scheme that allows companies in all sectors to hire existing WPHs (who are in Singapore) from other sectors, with the agreement of their current employers. 

Companies can also hire existing WPHs from their own or another sector, where the work permits are within 40 days of expiry. This is an extension of a scheme that exists for the construction and process sectors for transfers within their own sectors. Agreement from the current employer is not needed. 

Hiring firms will be required to meet the prevailing criteria under their respective sectors. This temporary scheme will be in place for five months until 31 August 2020. 

For inter-sectoral transfers (earlier than 40 days before work permit expiry), firms can approach SBF at <a href = "mailto: manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg">manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg</a> or visit their website for more information. For transfer of WPHs from 40 days before work permit expiry (including inter-sectorial transfers), firms can submit their request via an online form or visit MOM’s website for more information.

#### **7. My business is no longer allowed to operate. Do I still need to pay my employees, or should I let them go on leave?**
The Jobs Support Scheme announced by the Government is meant to support employers to retain and continue to pay their local employees, even during periods of reduction in business activity.

The latest Advisory on salary and leave arrangements can be found on the MOM website at <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-salary-and-leave" target="_blank">https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-salary-and-leave</a>

#### **8. What can employees of firms which are not allowed to resume service do, if they are told to leave the company due to refusal to report to work?**
Employees who have been wrongfully dismissed may file a claim against the wrongful dismissal or make a phone advisory appointment with the <a href="https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices" target="_blank">Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)</a>.

For more information on what constitutes a wrongful dismissal, please refer to the <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment/unfair-dismissal#what-is-a-wrongful-dismissal" target="_blank">Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal</a>.

#### **9. I need some employees to work at a construction site. Do I need to seek BCA’s approval before I can apply for a time-limited exemption?**
If you are requesting to continue with physical/actual building works on the construction site, you are required to obtain an approval from BCA first at 1800-342-5222 or <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform" target="_blank">www.bca.gov.sg/feedbackform</a> before you can proceed.

However, if the work that you will be conducting at the construction site is non-construction related (eg. administrative work done at the office), you do not need to seek BCA’s approval before applying for the Time-Limited Exemption. 

#### **10. Where can permitted enterprise workers take their meals if they are not near home? Do these individuals have to furnish proof of being a permitted enterprise worker if questioned by enforcement officers?**
Employers of such workers have the responsibility to look after the welfare of their workers and provide their workers with a suitable sheltered space within the work place premise to consume meals, such as staff canteens, pantries, or any other rest area. Employers should ensure that their workers observe the following in these spaces:
1. Workers should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual; 
2. Staggered meal times to reduce the interactions between their workers and prevent congregation; and
3. Workers should dine quickly and leave the space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals.

Workers who have fixed work stations which are suitable for consuming food at should also be allowed by their employers to individually consume their meals there.

Premises owners and managers who have permitted enterprise workers working within their malls or buildings can designate an area within their premises for these workers to have their meals e.g. part of a food court within a mall.

Permitted enterprise and selected service workers whose work requires them to be on the move e.g. delivery services, transport services, or home healthcare services, should return to their office or homes for their meals. If this is not practical, they can eat in their vehicles, or in public spaces such as void decks, park benches. Workers should observe the following while doing so:

a. Dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;<br>
b. Dine quickly and leave the public space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals; and<br>
c. Carry identification to indicate their employment status as permitted enterprise and selected service workers, and provide the identification upon request by Safe Distancing Ambassadors, Enforcement Officers, and police officers.

Hawkers and coffeeshop stall operators may consume their meals at tables in front of their stalls. They should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual, not share tables with other individuals or congregate.
