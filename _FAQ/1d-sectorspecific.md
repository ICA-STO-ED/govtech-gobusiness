#### **1. Can MSF Social Service Officers continue to deliver essential supplies to needy families during the period of suspension of activities? Can they also enlist volunteers’ help?**
Yes, so long as the necessary precautionary measures are taken (e.g. safe distancing, temperature monitoring, observe good personal hygiene). This is because needy families depend on the essential supplies to survive and such essential supplies should not be interrupted as a result of the suspension of activities.

#### **2. Are liquor stores allowed to continue operations?**
Liquor stores are allowed to continue operations.

#### **3. My F&B outlet is located within the premises of an essential service (e.g. hospital). Can it be allowed to open during the period of suspension of activities?**
Yes. F&B outlets serving Essential Services should remain open for their workers and provide dine-in options where workers have no other option. 

Canteen operators should advise members of the public to take-away only.

#### **4. Can I continue to fulfil customers’ online orders (non-food) and send the items ordered via delivery during this period?**
Retail businesses can continue to sell their products online and provide delivery and installation services to customers. However, they are not permitted to open their physical stores to customers unless they are an essential service. Delivery and installation personnel are required to comply with the health and safe distancing advisories set out by the government. 

#### **5. I am not an essential firm and have a shipment of goods coming in, will I be allowed to send the goods to my warehouse and will I be able to activate my employees to receive the shipment at my warehouse?**
Port operators and logistics service providers will be allowed to continue to operate during this period. Yes, you may receive deliveries at your premises. If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time to receive deliveries and perform other related tasks, please apply for a time-limited exemption.

#### **6. If the factory is closed, but some of the components are being shipped in, can the company still maintain a minimum number of workers onsite to clear the goods?**
Yes, the intention is to keep goods flowing in and to keep the port clear.
