#### **1. Can Social Service Agencies and charitable groups continue to deliver essential supplies to needy families during the period of suspension of activities? Can they also enlist volunteers’ help?**
Yes, so long as the necessary precautionary measures are taken (e.g. safe distancing, temperature monitoring, observe good personal hygiene, limit the number of staff/volunteer movement). This is because needy families depend on the essential supplies to survive and such essential supplies should not be interrupted as a result of the suspension of activities. Organisations and volunteers are strongly encouraged to limit their activities to critical and urgent needs (e.g. essential supplies to survive).

Liquor stores are allowed to continue operations.

#### **3. My F&B outlet is located within the premises of an essential service (e.g. hospital). Can it be allowed to open during the period of suspension of activities?**
Yes. F&B outlets serving Essential Services should remain open for their workers and provide dine-in options where workers have no other option. 

Canteen operators should advise members of the public to take-away only.

#### **4. Can I continue to fulfil customers’ online orders (non-food) and send the items ordered via delivery during this period?**
Retail businesses can continue to sell their products online and provide delivery and installation services to customers. However, they are not permitted to open their physical stores to customers unless they are an essential service. Delivery and installation personnel are required to comply with the health and safe distancing advisories set out by the government. 

#### **5. I am not an essential firm and have a shipment of goods coming in, will I be allowed to send the goods to my warehouse and will I be able to activate my employees to receive the shipment at my warehouse?**
Port operators and logistics service providers will be allowed to continue to operate during this period. Yes, you may receive deliveries at your premises. If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time to receive deliveries and perform other related tasks, please apply for a time-limited exemption.

#### **6. If the factory is closed, but some of the components are being shipped in, can the company still maintain a minimum number of workers onsite to clear the goods?**
Yes, the intention is to keep goods flowing in and to keep the port clear.

#### **7. Are hotels deemed as providing an essential service? Will they be allowed to continue operations?**
Licensed hotels, serviced apartments, dormitories and hostels are considered essential services if they support Stay Home Notice (SHN), Government Quarantine Facility (GQF), Community Isolation Facility (CIF) and accommodation needs of students, healthcare workers, foreigners, and foreign workers affected by travel restrictions, as well as house existing occupants. These establishments can continue to operate until informed otherwise.

Hotels providing the abovementioned services must close all on-site recreational facilities, while their F&B facilities may remain open for takeaway or delivery only. They must also minimise the number of on-site staffing and all hotel staff who can perform their roles remotely (e.g., finance, HR) must telecommute.

#### **8. I have received queries from healthcare workers who wish to make reservations to stay at my hotel as it is nearer to their workplace. Can I accept these bookings?**
We should support our frontline workers in their work. Hotels can take in such bookings but should verify that the person is a healthcare worker by verifying their staff pass.


#### **9. What kind of vehicle/ motor services are allowed during the circuit breaker period?**
Vehicle workshops that provide vehicle recovery and repair services for emergency cases will be allowed to continue operating. This is necessary to ensure that essential firms and workers in essential services who rely on their vehicles for transport and delivery are able to have their vehicles recovered and repaired in the event of a breakdown, accident or other emergency. Vehicle workshops that continue to operate are required to submit details on their operations and manpower requirements at https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg by 13 April for review.

Vehicle workshops are not permitted to provide regular servicing and cosmetic-related repairs that are not emergency vehicle services.

Businesses that are allowed to remain open must implement enhanced safe distancing measures to reduce physical interactions. We urge all businesses to play their part in the fight against COVID-19.
