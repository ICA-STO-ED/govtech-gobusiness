#### **1. Can Social Service Agencies and charitable groups continue to deliver essential supplies to needy families during the period of suspension of activities? Can they also enlist volunteers’ help?**
Yes, so long as the necessary precautionary measures are taken (e.g. safe distancing, temperature monitoring, observe good personal hygiene, limit the number of staff/volunteer movement). This is because needy families depend on the essential supplies to survive and such essential supplies should not be interrupted as a result of the suspension of activities. Organisations and volunteers are strongly encouraged to limit their activities to critical and urgent needs (e.g. essential supplies to survive).
