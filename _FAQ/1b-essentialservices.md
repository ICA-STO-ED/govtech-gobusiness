#### **1. How will I know whether my company is carrying out an essential activity and should therefore be exempted from suspension?**
Only essential services and related supply chains are exempted from the suspension. Carefully review the full list of essential services exempted from the suspension. **If your company performs any of the services, you may continue to perform those services and operate from your workplace premises with safe distancing practices in place.** Please submit the relevant details as soon as possible for review. In the meantime, you can continue operating until informed otherwise. Should your services be found not to be part of the list of essential services, you will be required to stop operations.

#### **2. My company’s activities are not listed in the list of essential services, but we support an essential service that is listed. What should I do?**
If your company supports an essential service, please submit an application for general exemption. You will need to provide details such as the names of the essential firms and the goods and/or services that you provide to these firms. 

You should suspend operations until you have received approval or exemption. 

#### **3. My company provides essential services and I have been contacted by a government agency. Why do I still need to submit details of my operations in order to continue operating?**
This is so that agencies can verify the nature your business activities and assess the number of workers that need to operate on-site. All activities of your company that can take place through telecommuting must be conducted through telecommuting from home.

#### **4. My company is carrying out an essential activity and I have submitted details of my operations and manpower more than 24 hours ago but I have not gotten a reply. What should I do?**
You may continue with on-site operations until you receive a reply from us. Do check your junk mail folder and add Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg to your safe recipients list.

#### **5. My company’s activities are not listed in the list of essential activities but they are essential. Can I apply for an exemption?**
If your company’s activities are not listed the list of essential activities, you must suspend your on-site activities.  You may continue telecommuting activities from home.  If you believe that your company’s activities are essential and you would like to be considered for an exemption, please submit a general application, with the relevant supporting information including justifications for why your activities are essential. All applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You must wait for approval of your exemption application before you re-commence onsite activities.  

#### **6. If I am an essential services company, is there a limit on the number of employees who can work during this period?**
Yes, companies should operate using the minimum number of employees required during this period. Those who can work from home should be encouraged to do so. Safe distancing measures will need to continue to be adhered to in the office.

#### **7. My business is exempted from the suspension, is there anything I should be aware of or put in place?**
Even if your business has been exempted from suspension, you should only get employees to return to the workplace to conduct essential activities where telecommuting is not possible. Where possible, businesses are encouraged to adopt video and audio conferencing tools to support their workers to work from home. In addition, businesses will be required to reduce physical interactions and observe stricter safe distancing measures.

Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home, including temporarily redeploying these employees to another role within the company that is suitable for working from home.

Employers must reduce physical interactions by: 
1. Reducing the need for and duration of physical interactions; 
2. Staggering working hours; 
3. Postponing all group events; and 
4. Implementing shift work and/or split team arrangements. 

F&B establishments are to open for takeaway and/or delivery only. Outlets which do not currently offer take-away and/or delivery should aim to do so, or allow third-party food delivery services to do so for them. While patrons and delivery drivers can continue to enter the premises to access take-away services, there will be no dine-in service, and nobody is permitted to consume any food or drinks on-site whilst waiting for takeaway food. For sustainability, consumers are encouraged to bring your own containers for take-away service. 

Please adhere to the safe distancing measures in the premise. These include minimising crowds by ensuring patrons are spaced at least 1 metre apart at all times (i.e. within the premise and when queuing).

Outlets that remain open are required to adhere to the safe distancing measures. These include minimising crowds by ensuring patrons are spaced at least 1 metre apart at all times (i.e. within the premise and when queuing).

#### **8. Where can essential workers (e.g. Grab drivers, bus drivers, workers working in the food and beverage industry) take their meals if they are not near home? Do these individuals have to furnish proof of being an essential worker if questioned by enforcement officers?**
Employers of such workers have the responsibility to look after the welfare of their workers and provide their workers with a suitable sheltered space within the work place premises to consume meals, such as staff canteens, pantries, or any other rest area. Employers should ensure that their workers observe the following in these spaces:
1. Workers should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Staggered meal times to reduce the interactions between their workers and prevent congregation; and
3. Workers should dine quickly and leave the space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals.

If the workers have fixed work stations which are suitable for consuming food, they should also be allowed by their employers to individually consume their meals there.

Premises owners and managers who have essential service workers working within their malls or buildings can designate an area within their premises for these workers to have their meals e.g. part of a food court within a mall.

For essential service and selected service workers whose work requires them to be on the move e.g. delivery services, transport services, they should return to their office or homes for their meals. If this is not practical, they can eat in their vehicles, or in public spaces such as void decks, park benches. Workers should observe the following while doing so:
1. Dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual;
2. Dine quickly and leave the public space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals; and
3. Carry identification to indicate their employment status as essential service and selected service workers, and provide the identification upon request by Safe Distancing Ambassadors, Enforcement Officers, and police officers.

Hawkers and coffeeshop stall operators may consume their meals at tables in front of their stalls. They should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual, not share tables with other individuals or congregate.
