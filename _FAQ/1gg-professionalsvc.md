#### **1. If my law practice is providing legal services in one or more of the four categories of legal activities identified as essential services, does that mean we can continue to operate from our workplace as usual without applying for an exemption?**
If your law practice is providing legal services in one or more of the four categories of legal activities identified as essential legal services and any personnel needs to be physically present at your office during the relevant period, you will still need to apply for a one-time General Exemption at https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg. When submitting your application, please ensure you provide the relevant details of your operations for review including justifications for why your activities are essential.

You may wish to refer to the FAQs for more information on the safe distancing measures that businesses providing essential services must adhere to when operating at your office during this period.

#### **2. If the legal services that my firm provides does not fall within one of the four categories of legal activities identified as essential services, can I continue to operate?**
If the services that your law practice provides does not fall under one of the four categories of legal activities identified as <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essenatiallegal" target="_blank">essential legal services</a>, you must suspend all in-person activities at your office.

For short term entry into your office, you will need to apply for a <a href="https://go.gov.sg/timelimitedexemption" target="_blank">time-limited exemption</a>. Please submit your application **one day before** the required date of use.

#### **3. Our law practice did not apply for a General Exemption as we do not have to be at the office most days. Can we drop into the office just for a while to receive documents, collect mail or to perform maintenance of the facility? Do we need to apply for an exemption? What if we need to go into the office to settle some work matters?**
If you are the owner of the law practice and need to return to your office premises even for short-term entry, to attend to work matters (except for brief entry for the limited situations illustrated above), you must still apply for a Time-Limited Exemption. Your employees are not permitted to go to your place of business. If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), you need to apply for a time-limited exemption.

You may submit a Time-Limited Exemption application one day in advance <a href="https://go.gov.sg/timelimitedexemption" target="_blank">time-limited exemption</a>, and the exemption will be valid for the period requested. Where either an employee or the business owner/employer will be the only person working at your workplace, you may indicate “1” staff.

Where granted such a Time-Limited Exemption, you must ensure that safe distancing measures are strictly adhere to while at the office. Please refer <here> for the guidelines on safe distancing at the office.

#### **4. If my law practice provides more than one of the legal activities identified as essential services, do we need to submit separate applications for each activity?**
Your law practice will only need to submit one application.

#### **5. Can my law practice continue to operate while waiting for the outcome of our application?**
For law practices that are providing legal services identified as essential services, you must ensure that you submit an application for General Exemption and retain proof of having done so. You may continue to operate while waiting for a reply from the General Exemption application in respect of the provision of such essential legal services. However, you are required to continue to strictly comply with the Safe Distancing advisory and other guidance available to providers of essential services.

If the services that your law practice provides are not one of the four categories of legal activities identified as <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essenatiallegal" target="_blank">essential legal services</a>, you must suspend all in-person activities at your office premises during the Circuit Breaker period. You may continue to operate if the services can be performed by telecommuting from home. For short-term entry into your office, you will need to apply for a Time-Limited Exemption.
