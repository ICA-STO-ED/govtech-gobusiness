#### **1. If my law practice is providing legal services in one or more of the four categories of legal activities identified as essential services, does that mean we can continue to operate from our workplace as usual without applying for an exemption?**
If your law practice is providing legal services in one or more of the four categories of legal activities identified as essential legal services and any personnel needs to be physically present at your office during the relevant period, you will still need to apply for a one-time General Exemption at <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg</a>. When submitting your application, please ensure you provide the relevant details of your operations for review including justifications for why your activities are essential.

You may wish to refer to the FAQs for more information on the safe distancing measures that businesses providing essential services must adhere to when operating at your office during this period.

#### **2. If the legal services that my firm provides does not fall within one of the four categories of legal activities identified as essential services, can I continue to operate?**
If the services that your law practice provides does not fall under one of the four categories of legal activities identified as <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essenatiallegal" target="_blank">essential legal services</a>, you must suspend all in-person activities at your office. You may continue to operate if the services can be performed by telecommuting from home. For short term entry into your office, you will need to apply for a time-limited exemption.

#### **3. Our law practice did not apply for a General Exemption as we do not have to be at the office most days. Can we drop into the office just for a while to receive documents, collect mail or to perform maintenance of the facility? Do we need to apply for an exemption? What if we need to go into the office to settle some work matters?**
If you are the owner of the law practice and need to return to your office premises even for short-term entry, to attend to work matters (except for brief entry for the limited situations illustrated above), you must still apply for a Time-Limited Exemption. Your employees are not permitted to go to your place of business. If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), you need to apply for a time-limited exemption.

You may submit a Time-Limited Exemption application one day in advance <a href="https://go.gov.sg/timelimitedexemption" target="_blank">here</a>, and the exemption will be valid for the period requested. Where either an employee or the business owner/employer will be the only person working at your workplace, you may indicate “1” staff.

Where granted such a Time-Limited Exemption, you must ensure that safe distancing measures are strictly adhere to while at the office. Please refer <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-safe-distancing-measures" target="_blank">here</a> for the guidelines on safe distancing at the office.

#### **4. If my law practice provides more than one of the legal activities identified as essential services, do we need to submit separate applications for each activity?**
Your law practice will only need to submit one application.

#### **5. Can my law practice continue to operate while waiting for the outcome of our application?**
For law practices that are providing legal services identified as essential services, you must ensure that you submit an application for General Exemption and retain proof of having done so. You may continue to operate while waiting for a reply from the General Exemption application in respect of the provision of such essential legal services. However, you are required to continue to strictly comply with the Safe Distancing advisory and other guidance available to providers of essential services.

If the services that your law practice provides are not one of the four categories of legal activities identified as <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essenatiallegal" target="_blank">essential legal services</a>, you must suspend all in-person activities at your office premises during the Circuit Breaker period. You may continue to operate if the services can be performed by telecommuting from home. For short-term entry into your office, you will need to apply for a Time-Limited Exemption.

The advisory for law practices during the period of elevated safe distancing measures can be found <a href="https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/news/announcements/advisory-for-law-practices-on-elevated-safe-distancing-measures" target="_blank">here</a>. 

#### **6. It was announced on 2 May that some of the tighter circuit breaker measures will be progressively eased in the coming weeks, does this mean law practices can resume regular business activities?**
The legal sector as a whole has not been identified as one of the sectors which can resume regular business activities yet; only law practices that have been granted a General Exemption to carry out essential legal services activities can operate within the manpower quota allotted.

#### **7. Is it necessary for our law practice to adopt Safe Management Measures?**
From 12 May 2020, all businesses allowed to operate during the Circuit Breaker period must implement Safe Management Measures. Law practices operating during the Circuit Breaker period under General Exemption are also required to implement Safe Management Measures. 

For businesses resuming operations after the Circuit Breaker period, all Safe Management Measures should be in place before operations can resume at the workplace. Law practices should begin to put in place Safe Management Measures at your office premises ahead of time. 

For more information about Safe Management Measures, please refer to <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures" target="_blank">“Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace after Circuit Breaker period”</a>. 

#### **8. Is the resumption of business activities for legal services limited to only the four categories of legal activities identified as essential services in the Ministry of Law’s advisory of 5 April 2020 or are other legal services now permitted as well?**
The resumption of business activities for legal services extends beyond the four essential legal services outlined during the Circuit Breaker period. Law practices that did not previously apply for General or Time-Limited Exemptions will be able to resume business activities from 2 June 2020, subject to implementation of Safe Management Measures.

Law practices may refer to the guidelines on implementation of Safe Management Measures on <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures" target="_blank">“Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace after Circuit Breaker period”</a>.

#### **9. Is there a minimum percentage or number of employees that law practices must place on work from home arrangements with the resumption of business activities from 2 June 2020?**
The reduction of physical interaction, together with other Safe Management Measures at the workplace, is necessary to ensure a safe working environment and minimise the spread of COVID-19. Employers should adopt telecommuting to the maximum as far as reasonably practicable. The proportion of employees that are able to telecommute will vary in different workplaces and sectors due to differing operational requirements. The onus is on the employers to show that they have made reasonable effort to facilitate working from home.

#### **10. Are my employees and visitors required to wear a mask at all times at the workplace?**
For general office workplaces, employers must ensure that employees and visitors wear a mask at all times at the workplace, except during activities that require masks to be removed such as when eating or drinking. Supplementary personal protective equipment is encouraged, whenever relevant. This is in addition to the other Safe Management Measures that must be in place at the workplace.

When attending remote court hearings via video or teleconferencing, lawyers may remove their masks to speak, while observing other Safe Management Measures.

#### **11. Pertaining to service of court process and documents, will the court process servers of law practices be able to carry out services of process on parties including individuals at their residences or offices?**
The service of court processes and documents is permissible, including delivery by hand where necessary, as process servers will be providing an essential service of the law practice, which is a permitted business. The process servers should observe safe distancing and take all other necessary precautions required under the Control Order at all times.

#### **12. Will clients of law practices be able to be physically present at the offices of law practices for the purpose of meetings, notarization, signing of wills, contracts, mortgages, instruments of conveyancing and other legal documents?**
Physical attendance at the office by clients of law practices is permitted only where their physical presence is necessary, such as to complete a contract or transaction that is legally required to be completed in person. Employees of the law practice and clients are required to observe Safe Management Measures requirements at all times.
