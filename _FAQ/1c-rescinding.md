#### **1. I received an email notification that my previously approved exemption has been rescinded. Why is that so?**
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced on 14 April 2020 that there will be a further tightening of the list of companies that are permitted to operate during the Circuit Breaker period to reduce the number of on-site employees and minimise people movement. We are acutely aware that the circuit breaker will disrupt businesses and be painful, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19.

If you have received an email notification that your exemption has been rescinded, you must suspend all on-site operations at your business premise.

#### **2. I have been asked to suspend operations recently, but I noticed that another company in a similar industry is continuing operations. Why is that so?**
The Circuit Breaker measures aim to reduce the number of employees who have to work on-site and travel to and from work, to lower the risk of infections. Likewise, we seek to minimise the load on the supply chains. Where possible, we aggregate the essential needs and services to be provided by the fewest firms possible. Therefore, all else being equal, the firms that provide a range of aggregated services with more limited requirements for manpower and movements will more likely be supported for continued operations during this period.

If you know of a business operating even though it has not been granted exemption, please report this business and provide relevant details such as its name, address and relevant evidence (eg. photographs) to <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>.

#### **3. I received an email notification that my previously approved exemption has been rescinded. Does this mean I have to suspend business operations immediately?**
Yes. If your exemption has been rescinded, you must cease operations within 24 hours from the email notification timestamp.

#### **4. My application approval has been rescinded. Can I appeal?**
The decision to rescind your exemption is final. Appeals will generally not be granted.

#### **5. My application approval has been rescinded, can I/my staff return to our workplace to pack and make alternative work arrangements? Do I need to apply for time-limited exemptions?**
Everyone should minimise travel outside of their homes. As the owner, you may return to your business facility for a short duration, to take care of crucial tasks that cannot be done remotely or to retrieve necessary materials or documents, without submitting a request for time-limited exemption. You should leave the premises immediately once the crucial tasks are completed.

Your employees are not permitted to go to your place of business.  They may work remotely from home.

If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), please apply for a time-limited exemption through <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg</a>. For more details on applying for a time-limited exemption, you may refer to the video tutorial <a href="https://go.gov.sg/timelimitedexemp" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **6. Why is there a need to further tighten headcounts even though I am an essential firm? I have already submitted my companyâ€™s plans/manpower requirements.**
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced on 14 April 2020 that there will be a further tightening of the list of companies that are permitted to operate during the Circuit Breaker period to reduce the number of on-site employees and minimise people movement.

Companies that continue to operate during this period should use the minimum number of employees required. You will be required to submit details of your essential manpower at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essentialworkers" target="_blank">Registration of Essential Manpower</a> from 19 April. 

#### **7. I heard that there are some companies who have received a rescind notification. If I have not received such notification, am I still allowed to operate? Are there any guidelines I should adhere to?**
Yes. Companies which have not received any further notification to suspend their operations are allowed to continue operations, if they had earlier received an exemption from suspension of activities.

In line with the latest announcement on 2 May 2020, selected F&B and retail operations such as retail outlets of cakes, confectionery, packaged snacks and desserts will be allowed to resume from 12 May 2020. For more information, please click <a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/media-centre/media-releases/2020/may-2020/updated-safe-distancing-measures-for-food-and-beverage-establishments" target="_blank">here</a> for the latest set of advisories.

Companies which continue operations during this period should ensure the following:
- Cross-deployment or movement of employees across different workplace premises (e.g. different branches) will be disallowed. There should also be no physical interactions between teams working in different locations. For essential service providers who need to move between different locations to perform their services (e.g. IT support, maintenance, logistics, community nurses making house visits), safe distancing measures must be complied to.
- Employers and on-site managers are required to implement strict safe distancing measures within their premises, provide company-arranged transport and reduce social interactions among employees during their course of work, as well as during their meal and break times. Employers and on-site managers should ensure that employees on-site are wearing masks.
- Employers are required to ensure that their employees have appropriate housing options to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19.

#### **8. What would happen to companies which are found operating even when their exemption approval has been rescinded?**
Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders found operating without an exemption approval will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

#### **9. Are home-based F&B businesses allowed to continue operations?**
From 12 May 2020, home-based food businesses (under the Housing & Development Board/Urban Redevelopment Authority home-based small scale business scheme) will be allowed to resume operations, subject to the necessary safe management measures being in place.
