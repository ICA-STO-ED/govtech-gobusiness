#### **1. How do I know if I am affected by the new measures to suspend certain F&B and retail operations?**
If you have previously been issued an approval to operate during the circuit breaker and you conduct one of the activities that must now be suspended, MTI will send you an email to rescind the previous approval. For further details, please click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/tightenmeansure" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **2. When will the suspension of certain F&B and retail outlets take effect? How long will it last?**
The suspension of on-site operations of specialised stores and outlets retailing predominantly beverages, packaged snacks and desserts, F&B outlets in parks and certain retail outlets will take effect 24 hours after you have received the notification from MTI to wind down business operations completely. These tighter measures will be in place minimally for a two-week period from 21 April 2020 until 4 May 2020 (inclusive). The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will monitor the situation closely and determine when it is appropriate to ease some of the measures.

#### **3. My business falls under the list of activities that need to be suspended. Can I appeal?**
If your business does not fall under the latest list of essential services, you will not be allowed to operate.


## **<ins>F&B</ins>**

#### **1. I own a bakery that sells mainly assorted bread. However, based on the new measures, am I allowed to also continue selling cakes and other products?**
Bakeries that sell a mix of breads and cakes can continue to operate. However, given that the manufacturing of cakes and confectionery has to stop, bakeries that get their cakes and confectioneries from cake and confectionery manufacturers, will not be able to do so after their existing stocks are cleared.

#### **2. My store sells predominantly hot meals (eg. sandwiches) but I also sell desserts. Can I continue to operate?**
If your shop sells multiple items, we will take into consideration what you predominantly sell. For example, if you predominantly sell hot meals and some selection of desserts, you can continue sales of all the food items that are not within the manufacturing suspended scope.

#### **3. Are cafes allowed to continue operations?**
F&B outlets which provide full meals will be allowed to continue to operate.

#### **4. My store sells soy bean milk and snacks which are considered hot/cooked food. I am not sure if I need to suspend operations. What should I do?**
If your company sells predominantly soy bean milk and snacks, you will need to suspend your business immediately. If you have previously been issued an approval to operate during the circuit breaker and conduct one of the activities that must now be suspended, MTI will send you an email to rescind the previous approval.

#### **5. Why are beverages, snacks and desserts in hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts still allowed to open?**
In general, coffee shops, hawker centres and food courts are exempted from suspension in their entirety as we recognise that these establishments provide affordable food options for the public and we view all individual stalls as forming the overall offerings of these establishments. However, we advise the public not to rush to queue at bubble tea, desert and beverage stalls, and to observe safe distancing measures when making such purchases. The government will continue to monitor the situation and review when necessary.

#### **6. My cake shop is located in the premise of an essential service provider (e.g. Hospital). Am I allowed to continue operations?**
No. If your shop retails predominantly desserts such as cakes, you will not be allowed to continue operations.

#### **7. I am a key manufacturer of confectioneries. Does that mean I have to suspend operations too?**
Manufacturers of cakes and confectionery will have to suspend operations.

#### **8. Why are food vending machines not allowed to operate in parks?**
F&B outlets and food vending machines in parks will be suspended to minimise movement and interaction amongst the public. Drinks vending machines in parks will remain operational.

#### **9. I have been informed that I will need to suspend my F&B operations. Can I still continue operations if we close our shopfront and only accept online orders?**
Please note that all operations at the shop front must be suspended. Online retail of these food products, if any, must be fulfilled from the licensed central kitchens, manufacturing facilities or warehouses of the F&B establishment (if applicable). The manufacturing facility must not be part of the list indicated in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/fnbtightenmeansure" target="_blank">Annex 2</a> of the F&B advisory, in line with restrictions to reduce the number of businesses allowed.

#### **10. My application for exemption was earlier approved but my business operations fall under the list of F&B activities that needs to be suspended. Am I still allowed to continue operations?**
No, you must suspend your F&B operations as this notice supersedes the exemption approval that you received earlier.

#### **11. Why is it that F&B establishments at parks cannot even operate for takeaway/delivery?**
This is to minimise movement and interaction amongst the public.  As F&B services in parks are considered less critical consumer services, they will be suspended.

#### **12. I have been informed to suspend my business operations, and would like to donate some food supplies, especially perishables. Are there any charities that I can approach?**

With effect from 21 April 2020, 2359hrs, all hairdressing and barber services must be suspended, including those that have previously received approval for basic hair cut services.

#### **2. My optical shop only serves walk-in customers. How can I operationalise my business to only accept customers by appointment?**
Optical shops may continue to operate, but strictly by appointment only. Shops must remain closed to walk-in customers, and no incidental retail of products and accessories are allowed. Optical shop operators can take appointments through its online website, social media channels, and/or phone calls. A proper register of the appointments should be kept and appointments should be scheduled such that the number of customers in-store at any point of time is kept to a minimum and in compliance with the safe distancing guidelines.

With effect from 21 April 2020, 2359 hours, retail laundry services must be suspended, including those that have previously received approval. Only automated/unmanned laundry services are allowed to remain open. Industrial laundry services may continue.

#### **4. Are convenience stores allowed to continue operations?**
Convenience stores selling predominantly food items are allowed to open but those located in parks must close.

#### **5. Can I continue with activities like photoshoot and livestreaming for the purpose of online retail in my retail store / warehouse?**
Yes. Activities that support online retail such as photoshoots and livestreaming may continue at retail stores/warehouse, as long as you have received a general exemption approval. However, these activities must be conducted expeditiously and retail stores must remain closed to walk-ins at all times. Retailers must also observe safe distancing measures at all times.

#### **6. My store sells health supplements / traditional chinese medicine such as birdâ€™s nest. Am I allowed to continue operations?**
No. All health supplements and traditional chinese medicine (TCM) stores will not be allowed to continue operations.

#### **7. I am retailing mobile phones and accessories but provide predominantly repair services for handphones. Am I allowed to open only the repair services section?**
Yes. Mobile phone shops which provide predominantly repair services can continue to operate. However, they are not allowed to sell handphones and accessories.

#### **8. I am selling personal hygiene and beauty care items such as shampoo, body wash and other skincare products. Am I allowed to open?**
No. Only pharmacies selling personal hygiene and beauty care items are allowed to open as they support the health and social services sector. All other stores retailing predominantly personal hygiene and beauty care items are not allowed to open.

#### **9. Is it compulsory for all malls/ standalone stores and supermarkets with high traffic to conduct contact tracing of customers? Are there any guidelines of how this should be done?**
All malls, standalone stores and supermarkets should, where reasonably practicable, implement temperature taking for customers at entrances to detect customers with fever. As the number of entrances and traffic flow will vary with each location, establishments should determine what is the most effective means of implementing this at their outlets.

Malls and supermarkets with high traffic should, where reasonably practicable, implement contact tracing of customers. They can make use of digital systems to do so.

We understand that malls and supermarkets would require time to implement the above but they should do so as soon as possible.

#### **10. What happens if I do not wish to provide my contact details when visiting the malls/ supermarkets?**
The malls/ supermarkets reserve the right to deny you entry into their premises.
