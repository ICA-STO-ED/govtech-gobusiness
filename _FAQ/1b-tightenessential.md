## **<ins>F&B</ins>**

#### **1. Why are we allowing confectionery shops and not standalone beverage shops to resume operations?**
Confectionery shops and standalone beverage shops were closed from 22 April as part of the national push to stem the spread of COVID-19.

The Government has carefully considered the gradual resumption of more F&B operations, and has prioritised retail outlets of food products including confectionery over beverages. The decision takes into consideration the prioritisation for consumers to have more food choices over beverage choices, while maintaining a gradual resumption of economic and community activity.

We will continue to monitor the situation and gradually allow the resumption of the F&B operations which remain closed for now.

#### **2. Why are specialised stores selling beverages in hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts still allowed to open?**
In general, coffee shops, hawker centres and food courts are exempted from suspension in their entirety as we recognise that these establishments provide affordable food options for the public and we view all individual stalls as forming the overall offerings of these establishments.

We will continue to monitor the situation and review where necessary.

#### **3. I have been informed that my F&B operations must remain suspended. Can I still continue operations if we close our shopfront and only accept online orders?**
You should suspend all operations at the shop front. Online retail of food products, if any, must be fulfilled from licensed central kitchens, manufacturing facilities or warehouses of the F&B establishment (if applicable).

#### **4. Some F&B establishments have started commercial collaborations to cross-sell beverages such as bubble tea as part of their menu offerings. Is this allowed?**
Food outlets that make commercial arrangements to cross-sell items on their menu offerings can do so only if:
- They utilise their existing manpower to prepare and sell these items. No cross deployment of staff (between the two businesses or across outlets) as per MOMâ€™s advisory. 
- The beverages must not form the bulk of the new menu offerings. 
- These items must be prepped at the food outlet. They are not allowed to prep at their standalone beverage outlet and bring the items over to sell.
- These items must be strictly sold online (whether sold individually or paired), and preferably paired with a food item on the menu.
- Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to among staff and delivery personnel at all times.

Both parties are to apply for such cross-selling arrangements at <a href = "mailto: food_division@enterprisesg.gov.sg">food_division@enterprisesg.gov.sg</a>. Enforcement officers on the ground have the authority to suspend operations if the cross-selling guidelines and safe distancing measures are not adhered to.

## **<ins>Retail</ins>**

#### **1. My optical shop only serves walk-in customers. How can I operationalise my business to only accept customers by appointment?**
Optical shops may continue to operate, but strictly by appointment only. Shops must remain closed to walk-in customers, and no incidental retail of products and accessories are allowed. Optical shop operators can take appointments through its online website, social media channels, and/or phone calls. A proper register of the appointments should be kept and appointments should be scheduled such that the number of customers in-store at any point of time is kept to a minimum and in compliance with the safe distancing guidelines.

#### **2. Are convenience stores allowed to continue operations?**
Convenience stores selling predominantly food items are allowed to open but those located in parks must close.

#### **3. Can I continue with activities like photoshoot and livestreaming for the purpose of online retail in my retail store / warehouse?**
Yes. Activities that support online retail such as photoshoots and livestreaming may continue at retail stores/warehouse, as long as you have received a general exemption approval. However, these activities must be conducted expeditiously and retail stores must remain closed to walk-ins at all times. Retailers must also observe safe distancing measures at all times.

#### **4. I am retailing mobile phones and accessories but provide predominantly repair services for handphones. Am I allowed to open only the repair services section?**
Yes. Mobile phone shops which provide predominantly repair services can continue to operate. However, they are not allowed to sell handphones and accessories.

#### **5. I am selling personal hygiene and beauty care items such as shampoo, body wash and other skincare products. Am I allowed to open?**
No. Only pharmacies selling personal hygiene and beauty care items are allowed to open as they support the health and social services sector. All other stores retailing predominantly personal hygiene and beauty care items are not allowed to open.

#### **6. Is it compulsory for all malls/ standalone stores and supermarkets with high traffic to conduct contact tracing of customers? Are there any guidelines of how this should be done?**
All malls, standalone stores and supermarkets must implement the following:
- Conduct temperature screening for customers at entrances to detect customers with fever.
- Implement contact tracing through the use of SafeEntry to facilitate the efficient collection of visitor information so that contact tracing can be done in a timely manner.
- Ensure that all staff, customers and other personnel on their premises have masks on at all times.
- Use floor markers to clearly demarcate queue lines for customers.
- Ensure at least one-metre spacing between customers at all times.

In addition to the above, supermarkets are encouraged to:
- Provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women.
- Use mall atriums or outdoor areas for temporary sale of goods to disperse crowds from their stores.
- Remind customers to limit entry to 1 per family when shopping at their stores, where practicable.

#### **7. What happens if I do not wish to provide my contact details when visiting the malls/ supermarkets?**
The malls/ supermarkets reserve the right to deny you entry into their premises.

#### **8. I have closed my physical retail shop and moved some of the goods home. Can I deliver the items from home, since we can continue to sell our products online?**
Online retail and delivery may continue if you are a formal registered business working from home during this period. You must ensure that:
- Product collection and delivery are spaced out and done alone.
- Pick-up and drop off of items must be contactless.
- Contact tracing is implemented, for example, through the use of SafeEntry or an alternative system, and ensure that delivery personnel are using TraceTogether app.
- Delivery personnel must observe at least one-metre spacing at all times and not cluster together.
