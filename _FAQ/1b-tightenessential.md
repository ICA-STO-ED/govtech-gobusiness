#### **1. How do I know if I am affected by the new measures to suspend certain F&B and retail operations?**
If you have previously been issued an approval to operate during the circuit breaker and you conduct one of the activities that must now be suspended, MTI will send you an email to rescind the previous approval. For further details, please click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/tightenmeansure" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **2. When will the suspension of certain F&B and retail outlets take effect? How long will it last?**
The suspension of on-site operations of specialised stores and outlets retailing predominantly beverages, packaged snacks and desserts, F&B outlets in parks and certain retail outlets will take effect 24 hours after you have received the notification from MTI to wind down business operations completely. These tighter measures will be in place minimally for a two-week period from 21 April 2020 until 4 May 2020 (inclusive). The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will monitor the situation closely and determine when it is appropriate to ease some of the measures.

#### **3. During the previous announcements, the Government has given businesses time to prepare for suspension. Why is there such a short notice this time? Can I return to the store to pack my items especially perishables?**
To prevent further spread of the virus, the Government has put in place more stringent safe distancing measures and these must kick in immediately. As such, only essential services that are more critical will be exempted from the suspension.

However, companies will be allowed to have a minimal number of workers return to their outlets on 22 April 2020 for the sole purpose of packing and organising their supplies (e.g. perishables). Their retail storefronts have to remain closed.

#### **4. My business falls under the list of activities that need to be suspended. Can I appeal?**
If your business does not fall under the latest list of essential services, you will not be allowed to operate.

#### **5. The list of establishments that must suspend operations include cakes, chocolate, cookies and confectioneries. Can bakeries remain open?**
Yes, bakeries that sell mainly bread are exempted from the suspension.

#### **6. My shop sells cakes/puffs and also bread. Am I allowed to continue operations?**
No. On-site operations of specialised stores and outlets retailing predominantly beverages, packaged snacks and desserts (including cakes, donuts, sweet pastries, chocolate, cookies and cut fruits) cannot continue operations. If your shop sells predominantly cakes/puffs, you cannot continue operations even if you sell some bread items.

#### **7. I own a bakery that sells mainly assorted bread. However, based on the new measures, am I allowed to also continue selling cakes and other products?**
Yes. You are allowed to sell the full range of products, provided the majority of the items are bread.

#### **8. My store sells a mixture of hot and pre-packaged food. Can I continue to sell the hot food at the store?**
You are allowed to open only if your food products are predominantly those that require hot food preparation at the store e.g. cooking, boiling, frying etc. If so, you can open in its entirety.

#### **9. My store sells soy bean milk and snacks which are considered hot/cooked food. I am not sure if I need to suspend operations. What should I do?**
If your company sells predominantly soy bean milk and snacks, you will need to suspend your business. If you have previously been issued an approval to operate during the circuit breaker and conduct one of the activities that must now be suspended, MTI will send you an email to rescind the previous approval.

#### **10. Why are beverages, snacks and desserts in hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts still allowed to open?**
Stalls operating at hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts will remain open in entirety as they provide food for the mass public.

#### **11. My cake shop is located in the premise of an essential service provider (e.g. Hospital). Am I allowed to continue operations?**
No. If your shop retails predominantly desserts such as cakes, you will not be allowed to continue operations.

#### **12. I am a key supplier of confectioneries. Does this mean I have to suspend operations too?**
You should not open your outlet for walk-in customers but can continue to supply to essential services like supermarkets and restaurants.

#### **13. I have been informed that I will need to suspend my operations. Can I still continue operations if we close our shopfront and only accept online orders?**
Please note that all operations at the shop front must be suspended. Online retail of these food products, if any, must be fulfilled from the licensed central kitchens, manufacturing facilities or warehouses of the F&B establishment (if applicable). The manufacturing facility must not be part of the list indicated in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/fnbtightenmeansure" target="_blank">Annex 2</a> of the F&B advisory, in line with restrictions to reduce the number of businesses allowed. 

#### **14. My application for exemption was earlier approved but my business operations fall under the list of F&B activities that needs to be suspended. Am I still allowed to continue operations?**
No, you must suspend your F&B operations as this notice supersedes the exemption approval that you received earlier.

Optical shop operators could take appointments through its online website, social media channels, and/or phone calls.
