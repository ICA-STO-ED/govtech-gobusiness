With effect from 12 May 2020, selected F&B and retail outlets will be allowed to resume operations.

If your business does not fall under the latest list of F&B and retail services that can resume operations, you will not be allowed to operate.

#### **4. My company is in the list of services that are allowed to resume operations on 12 May 2020. Do I need to re-apply for an exemption?**
No. You will not be required to seek an exemption before resuming operations. Taking into consideration the large number of businesses involved, MTI will grant these companies a class exemption to resume business subject to them implementing the safe management measures required.

Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Housing & Development Board (HDB), Singapore Food Agency (SFA), Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) have issued advisories on safe management measures that F&B and retail establishments should have in place when resuming operations.

## **<ins>F&B</ins>**

#### **1. Why are we allowing confectionery shops and not standalone beverage shops to resume operations?**
Confectionery shops and standalone beverage shops were closed from 22 April as part of the national push to stem the spread of COVID-19.

The Government has carefully considered the gradual resumption of more F&B operations, and has prioritised retail outlets of food products including confectionery over beverages. The decision takes into consideration the prioritisation for consumers to have more food choices over beverage choices, while maintaining a gradual resumption of economic and community activity.

We will continue to monitor the situation and gradually allow the resumption of the F&B operations which remain closed for now.

#### **2. Why are specialised stores selling beverages in hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts still allowed to open?**
In general, coffee shops, hawker centres and food courts are exempted from suspension in their entirety as we recognise that these establishments provide affordable food options for the public and we view all individual stalls as forming the overall offerings of these establishments.

We will continue to monitor the situation and review where necessary.

#### **3. I have been informed that my F&B operations must remain suspended. Can I still continue operations if we close our shopfront and only accept online orders?**
You should suspend all operations at the shop front. Online retail of food products, if any, must be fulfilled from licensed central kitchens, manufacturing facilities or warehouses of the F&B establishment (if applicable).

#### **4. Why is it that F&B establishments at parks cannot operate for takeaway/delivery?**
This is to minimise movement and interaction amongst the public.  As F&B services in parks are considered less critical consumer services, they will be suspended.

#### **5. Why are food vending machines not allowed to operate in parks?**
F&B outlets and food vending machines are closed in line with the guideline to minimise movement and interaction of people. Drinks vending machines in parks remain operational.

#### **6. Some F&B establishments have started commercial collaborations to cross-sell beverages such as bubble tea as part of their menu offerings. Is this allowed?**
Food outlets that make commercial arrangements to cross-sell items on their menu offerings can do so only if:
- They utilise their existing manpower to prepare and sell these items. No cross deployment of staff (between the two businesses or across outlets) as per MOMâ€™s advisory. 
- The beverages must not form the bulk of the new menu offerings. 
- These items must be prepped at the food outlet. They are not allowed to prep at their standalone beverage outlet and bring the items over to sell.
- These items must be strictly sold online (whether sold individually or paired), and preferably paired with a food item on the menu.
- Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to among staff and delivery personnel at all times.

Both parties are to apply for such cross-selling arrangements at <a href = "mailto: food_division@enterprisesg.gov.sg">food_division@enterprisesg.gov.sg</a>. Enforcement officers on the ground have the authority to suspend operations if the cross-selling guidelines and safe distancing measures are not adhered to.
