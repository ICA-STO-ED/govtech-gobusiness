: c. For 2020, qualifying commercial properties that have been more badly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, including hotels, serviced apartments, shops and restaurants **will pay no Property Tax**. Businesses in other non-residential properties will also receive a **Property Tax Rebate** of 30% for the year 2020. Please note that property owners will be obliged to pass on to their tenants the property tax rebate attributable to the rented property. 

**Broad based – Workforce related**
: a. Under the enhanced **Jobs Support Scheme**, the Government will help employers by paying 25% on the first $4,600 of monthly salaries, for 9 months.

To encourage enterprise to continue in their transformation efforts and share the productivity gains with their workers, the **Wage Credit Scheme** will be enhanced to offer more support in the co-funding of wage increase for Singaporean workers. The scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singapore employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. This will be raised to $5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020.

## **For essential services companies**

#### **How will I know whether my company is carrying out an essential activity and should therefore be exempted from suspension?**
Only essential services and related supply chains are exempted from the suspension. Carefully review the full list of essential services exempted from the suspension. **If your company performs any of the services, you may continue to perform those services and operate from your workplace premises with safe distancing practices in place.** You will need to submit the relevant details by end of 13 Apr for review, and can continue operating until informed otherwise. Should your services be found not to be part of the list of essential services, you will be required to stop operations.

#### **My company’s activities are not listed in the list of essential services, but we support an essential service that is listed. What should I do?**
If your company supports an activity, please submit a general application, you will need to provide details such as the names of the essential firms and the goods and/or services that you provide to these firms. We will respond to you within 48 hours if you are allowed to continue operating during the suspension period. You may continue with your support of the essential service while waiting for our response if you have safe distancing practices in place.  Should your services be found not to be a critical activity in support of an essential services, you will be required to stop operations.  

#### **My company provides essential services and I have been contacted by a government agency, why do I need to submit details of my operations in order to continue operating?**
This is so that agencies can verify the nature your business activities and assess the number of workers that need to operate on-site. All activities of your company that can take place through telecommuting must be conducted through telecommuting from home.

#### **My company is carrying out an essential activity and I have submitted details of my operations and manpower more than 24 hours ago but I have not gotten a reply. What should I do?**
You may continue with on-site operations until you receive a reply from us. Do check your junk mail folder and add Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg to your safe recipients list.

#### **My company’s activities are not listed in the list of essential activities but they are essential, can I apply for an exemption?**
If your company’s activities are not listed the list of essential activities, you must suspend your on-site activities.  You may continue telecommuting activities from home.  If you believe that your company’s activities are essential and you would like to be considered for an exemption, please submit a general application, with the relevant supporting information including justifications for why your activities are essential. All applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You must wait for approval of your exemption application before you re-commence onsite activities.  

#### **If I am an essential services company, is there a limit on the number of employees who can work during this period?**
Yes, companies should operate using the minimum number of employees required during this period. Those who can work from home should be encouraged to do so. Safe distancing measures will need to continue to be adhered to in the office.

#### **My business is exempted from the suspension, is there anything I should be aware of or put in place?**
Even if your business has been exempted from suspension, you should only get employees to return to the workplace to conduct essential activities where telecommuting is not possible. Where possible, businesses are encouraged to adopt video and audio conferencing tools to support their workers to work from home. In addition, businesses will be required to reduce physical interactions and observe stricter safe distancing measures.

Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home, including temporarily redeploying these employees to another role within the company that is suitable for working from home.

Employers must reduce physical interactions by: 
: a. Reducing the need for and duration of physical interactions; 
: b. Staggering working hours; 
: c. Postponing all group events; and 
: d. Implementing shift work and/or split team arrangements. 

**F&B** 
F&B establishments are to open for takeaway and/or delivery only. Outlets which do not currently offer take-away and/or delivery should aim to do so, or allow third-party food delivery services to do so for them. While patrons and delivery drivers can continue to enter the premises to access take-away services, there will be no dine-in service, and nobody is permitted to consume any food or drinks on-site whilst waiting for takeaway food. For sustainability, consumers are encouraged to bring your own containers for take-away service. 

Please adhere to the safe distancing measures in the premise. These include minimising crowds by ensuring patrons are spaced at least 1 metre apart at all times (i.e. within the premise and when queuing). 

**Food Retail (e.g. supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery & fruit stores)**
Outlets that remain open are required to adhere to the safe distancing measures. These include minimising crowds by ensuring patrons are spaced at least 1 metre apart at all times (i.e. within the premise and when queuing).

## **For non-essential services companies**

#### **Can I continue to run my business as normal if my company is not providing an essential service?**
If the service that your business provides is not on the essential services list, you must suspend all in-person activities and activities at your business location.  You can continue to operate if you and your employees are able to perform business functions from home and are strongly encouraged to do so.

#### **Is my company required to suspend all business activities if my operations cannot continue via telecommuting?**
Essential services and related supply chains are exempted from the suspension of on-site business activities. If your company’s business activities are non-essential, but can continue to operate via telecommuting, you may continue to do so. Where possible, businesses are encouraged to adopt video and audio conferencing and other IT tools to support their workers to work from home.

For selected functions that need to continue but cannot be performed via telecommuting due to sensitivity (e.g. payroll processing), please apply for a time-limited exemption. 

#### **Can my company continue to operate if I adhere to safe distancing and other precautionary measures (e.g. mandatory temperature taking, submission of travel declarations)?**
All non-essential activities outside the home shall be suspended during this period. Where employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, the employer must ensure that they do so.

Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home, including temporarily redeploying these employees to another role within the company that is suitable for working from home.

#### **If my business does not conduct essential activities, can I go to my place of business to perform maintenance of the facility, attend to perishable products, receive deliveries or perform other necessary tasks?**
If you are the owner of a non-essential business, you may go to your business location to take care of crucial tasks that cannot be done remotely or to retrieve necessary materials or documents. Your employees are not permitted to go to your place of business.  They may work remotely from home.

If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), you need to apply for a time-limited exemption.

If you need to maintain a small workforce at your place of business for safety purposes, please apply for a general exemption.

#### **What happens if my company is unable to pay employees’ salaries due to the suspension of activities?**
The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) will help enterprises retain their local employees during this period of uncertainty. All active employers, with the exception of Government organisations (local and foreign) and representative officers, are eligible for the JSS. For more details, please visit the IRAS website at http://www.iras.gov.sg or call the hotline 6356 8233.

#### **Is my company still required to pay rental during the period of suspension of activities?**
To provide greater support for businesses, stallholders at hawker centres and markets would get enhanced rental waiver of three months, with a minimum waiver of $200 per month. The eligible commercial tenants in Government-owned or managed facilities would be given two months of rental waivers, up from half a month. Government agencies such as JTC, SLA, HDB, URA, BCA, PA and Nparks would provide half a month rental waiver to eligible tenants of other non-residential premises. Eligible tenants include those who did not pay property tax.

#### **Should my company continue with medical insurance coverage for foreign employees, given that they are unable to work during the suspension of activities?**
Yes, employers who fail to meet the medical insurance requirement for their foreign workers (WP, S Pass holders and FDW) may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or both. In addition, they may be barred from employing foreign workers. The medical insurance requirement is not applicable to EP holders.

#### **Can my employees leave their dormitories during the period of suspension of activities?**
Yes, provided they are not sick and not under Leave of Absence (LOA)/Stay Home Notice (SHN) or Quarantine Orders (QO). However, they should only do so for essential activities, such as to get food, health care or commute to their job in an essential service. They should also observe safe distancing measures when they are out.

#### **Can foreign employees be redeployed to work on areas that are not within their current approved vocations? If so, what are the procedures that companies need to follow?**
Employers can write in to MOM with reasons for the redeployment and seek for permission to do so.

#### **If a company is not on the list of essential services, can it continue to operate from home? Must it also stop operations? E.g. trading firms, software development whose clients are overseas.**
Businesses that are not exempted can continue their operations as long as it does not require physical activity or staff movement in Singapore. These activities must take place through telecommuting.

## **Sector-specific queries**

#### **Can Social Service Organisations (SSOs) staff continue to deliver essential supplies to needy families during the period of suspension of activities? Can they also enlist volunteers’ help?**
Yes, so long as the necessary precautionary measures are taken (e.g. safe distancing, temperature monitoring, observe good personal hygiene). This is because needy families depend on the essential supplies to survive and such essential supplies should not be interrupted as a result of the suspension of activities.

#### **Are liquor stores considered F&B outlets?**
You are only allowed to operate if you are licensed as a food retailer. Otherwise, if you are licensed as a F&B outlet, only take-aways and/or deliveries are allowed. 

#### **My food establishment is located within a non-food premise (e.g. canteen located in an industrial estate). Can it be allowed to open during the period of suspension of activities?**
Yes, however, it should be opened for takeaways and/or deliveries only. No dine-in service is permitted. Patrons are not permitted to consume any food or drinks on-site whilst waiting for takeaway food.

#### **Can I continue to fulfil customers’ online orders (non-food) and send the items ordered via delivery during this period?**
Only companies providing essential services will be able to continue on-site operations during this period. For instance, supermarkets will continue to support delivery of non-food household items such as cleaning supplies. 

#### **I am not an essential firm and have a shipment of goods coming in, will I be allowed to send the goods to my warehouse and will I be able to activate my employees to receive the shipment at my warehouse?**
Port operators and logistics service providers will be allowed to continue to operate during this period. Yes, you may receive deliveries at your premises. If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time to receive deliveries and perform other related tasks, please apply for a time-limited exemption.

## **For Employees/Manpower**

#### **If my employer provides essential services and I am reporting to work, do I need to provide or carry with me any sort of documentation?**
Currently, you are not required to do so. You are encouraged to confirm with your employer that the function you perform is critical and meant to be performed on-site rather than via telecommuting. Employers are encouraged to provide this confirmation to the employee in writing.

#### **Can I go back to my office to pick up personal items?**
All non-essential activities outside the home must be suspended during this period in order to bring the transmission rate down effectively. Please refrain from all non-essential travel to reduce the possibility of transmissions.

#### **Can foreign worker levy be waived? Are there any other support measures avaiable for us during this period?**
Additional support measures for businesses will be announced on 6 April 2020. 

#### **What will happen to my foreign workers since I am not allowed to operate during this period? Can I repatriate my workers since I cannot operate now?**
Instead of repatriation or retrenchment, we urge employers to first consider cost-saving measures to manage excess manpower. E.g. look at training, redeployment, reasonable adjustment of salaries etc. Please take note of MOM’s guidelines on cost saving measures and retrenchment: [https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retrenchment){:target="_blank"}

If it is assessed that the foreigner workers are still not needed, employers may give consent for them to be transferred to other employers facing manpower shortages. Employers can approach SBF at manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg or visit SBF's website.

If foreign workers would like to head home, companies will have to cancel the work passes, repatriate the workers and bare the repatriation cost.

#### **I have been told to ramp up production during this time period but cannot find additional manpower, how do I source for workers during this time?**
MOM has partnered with the Singapore Business Federation to offer a temporary scheme that allows companies in all sectors to hire existing WPHs (who are in Singapore) from other sectors, with the agreement of their current employers. 

Companies can also hire existing WPHs from their own or another sector, where the work permits are within 40 days of expiry. This is an extension of a scheme that exists for the construction and process sectors for transfers within their own sectors. Agreement from the current employer is not needed. 

Hiring firms will be required to meet the prevailing criteria under their respective sectors. This temporary scheme will be in place for five months until 31 August 2020. 

For inter-sectoral transfers (earlier than 40 days before work permit expiry), firms can approach SBF at manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg or visit their website for more information. For transfer of WPHs from 40 days before work permit expiry (including inter-sectorial transfers), firms can submit their request via an online form or visit MOM’s website for more information.

#### **If the factory is closed, but some of the components are being shipped in, can the company still maintain a minimum number of workers to clear the good?**
Yes, the intention is to keep goods flowing in and to keep the port clear.

## **For general public**

#### **If I see a non-essential business continue to operate even though it is not supposed to, what should I do?**
Please report this business, including providing relevant details such as its name, address and relevant evidence (e.g. photographs) to Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg

#### **What do I do if I am unable to enter the supermarket/F&B outlets due to long queues?**
You may consider food takeaways at other F&B outlets or food/grocery delivery services.
