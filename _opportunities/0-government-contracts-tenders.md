Overview of Government Contracts and Tenders
Types of Goods & Services in Contracts & Tenders

All materials, manufactured items, consumables and non-consumables, e.g. computers, furniture, machinery, office equipment and supplies, etc.

Who Is In Charge of Purchasing
Each Government ministry, statutory board or department is in charge of purchasing its own goods and services.
The Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), and Government Technology Agency (GOVTECH) purchase goods and services that are commonly used by the entire public sector. For instance, paper, cleaning services, IT security services, courier services, etc.


How Does the Government Buy
The Government buys products and services through 3 procedures, based on the value of the contract.

A.   Small Value Purchases (Up to S$6,000)
The Government buys directly from suitable suppliers or “off the shelf” provided the prices assessed reflect fair market value.
Usually, the Government agency which requires the product or service will ask around for quotations and make a direct purchase.
These small value purchases are not publicised on Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ) - the Government's procurement portal.
Sourcing methods include:
Verbal or written quotes
Off the shelf purchase
GeBIZ Mall Catalogues


B.   Invitation to Quote (S$6,001 up to S$90,000)
The Government publishes a quote online at GeBIZ inviting suppliers to quote.
All businesses that wish to supply can submit a quote on GeBIZ.
In order to submit a quote, you must first register as a Government Supplier (GeBIZ Trading Partner) on GeBIZ.
Sourcing methods include:
Invitation to Quote (ITQ)
Request for Quotation (RFQ)
Period Contracts
Framework Agreements


C.   Invitation to Tender (Above S$90,000)
To tender for a project, you must also be a GeBIZ Trading Partner. There are 3 types of tenders:
Open
All interested parties can bid. Tenders are posted on GeBIZ.
Selective
A pre-qualification exercise is held to shortlist applicants who are then invited to bid. Tenders are posted on GeBIZ.
Limited
These tenders are by invitation only as they concern national security or are impractical for open tenders.
