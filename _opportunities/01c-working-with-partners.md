When to Partner with Other Companies
Form a ‘consortium’ or partnership when the potential procurement opportunity:
is too large for your company to manage
requires you to have alternative capabilities or expertise (e.g. systems integrator for mission critical projects)
 

Evaluation Guidelines for Consortium
The procuring Government agency will evaluate the consortium based on their combined financial health, i.e. the annual turnover or revenue of its members.
The consortium will be evaluated on their Net Tangible Asset (the sum of paid-up capital, revenue reserves and preference shares, among others) and annual turnover/sales/revenue based on the individual member’s EPPU registration.
The annual turnover of the consortium will be checked against the turnover/sales/revenue of the member with the highest turnover among the consortium members plus 50% of the sum of turnover of the remaining members.
For more details, please see Government Procurement Guidebook for SMEs.
