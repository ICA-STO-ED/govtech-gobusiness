Apply for required accreditations and qualifications.

For example, cleaning companies must obtain at least a ‘Clean Mark Silver Award’ under the Enhanced Clean Mark Accreditation Scheme before they can be awarded a cleaning contract.

Tendering for Government Contracts
Who Can Bid
All GeBIZ Trading Partners can bid.
Some tenders may require suppliers to be Expenditure and Procurement Policies Unit (EPPU) or Building and Construction Authority (BCA) registered.
You may put in a bid in your own capacity or form a consortium of suppliers to submit a bid.
Forming a consortium is useful for tenders of larger value where small suppliers may not be able to meet the financial and operational requirements on their own.
Consortiums can be made up of several businesses. They can combine their financial health and turnover to meet tender requirements.
For instance, to meet the Net Tangible Assets (NTA) requirement of a tender, the NTA of the consortium is equal to the NTA of the company with the highest NTA plus 50% of the sum of NTAs of all the other member companies.

All submissions are confidential until the Invitation-to-Tender is closed.
Three hours after a tender is closed, your tender details will be published under "Tender Schedule" on GeBIZ alongside other tenderers.
 

Requirement to Put Up a Security Deposit
Some tenders may ask for security deposits.
The security deposit will be refunded to you at the end of the contract according to the terms of the contract.
The amount of security deposit for goods and services contracts depends on the value of the contract.
Below S$500,000 - no security deposit
Above S$500,000 - 0%-5% of the contract value
For construction contracts, the security deposit is usually 0%-5% of the contract value.
 

Evaluation & Approval
The Tender Evaluation Committee evaluates while the Tender Approving Authority approves.
Members of the Evaluation Committee will not be part of the Tender Approving Authority.
A Tender Evaluation Committee will evaluate the bids based on value for money and critical criteria stated in the tender documents.
If you do not meet the critical criteria, you will be disqualified from further evaluation. The critical criteria will not be waived or changed during the evaluation.
Suppliers may be asked to give a presentation as part of the evaluation process.
The Tender Evaluation Committee will then make a recommendation to the Tender Approving Authority.
 

Possible Outcomes of a Tender
The Tender Approving Authority may choose :
to award the tender to one or more tenderers
not to award the tender
to abort the tender
Once the tender is awarded, it will be published under “Tender Award Notices” on GeBIZ.
