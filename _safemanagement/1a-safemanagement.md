To provide a safe working environment and to prevent transmission at the workplace, businesses are required to abide by the (nation-wide general guidelines for workplaces issued on 9 May 2020).

All businesses are to comply with the following requirements: 
- All employees whose functions can be done remotely (e.g. by telecommuting) be done from home 
- Employees should only return to the workplace when needed, for purposes that cannot be carried out via telecommuting (e.g. to access specialised terminals or dedicated machines).
- No face-to-face meetings with clients unless physical presence is required by law (e.g. to complete transactions).

Businesses should also adhere to the <a href="/safemanagement/sector/">sector-specific guidelines</a> released by the respective agencies.
