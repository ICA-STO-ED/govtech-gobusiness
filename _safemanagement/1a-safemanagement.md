To provide a safe working environment and to prevent transmission at the workplace, businesses are required to abide by the <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures">nation-wide general guidelines for workplaces issued on 9 May 2020</a>. Businesses should also adhere to the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/safemanagementsector">sector-specific guidelines</a> released by the respective agencies.

Businesses may also wish to refer to MTIâ€™s <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/05/MTI-Advisory-on-resumption-of-activities-from-2-June-2020.pdf" target="_blank">advisory</a> dated 19 May 2020, on the gradual resumption of business activities in phases starting from 2 June 2020.

All businesses are to comply with the following requirements: 
- All employees whose functions can be done remotely (e.g. by telecommuting) be done from home 
- Employees should only return to the workplace when needed, for purposes that cannot be carried out via telecommuting (e.g. to access specialised terminals or dedicated machines).
- No face-to-face meetings with clients unless physical presence is required by law (e.g. to complete transactions).
