To provide a safe working environment and to prevent transmission at the workplace, businesses are required to abide by the <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures">nation-wide general guidelines for workplaces issued on 9 May 2020</a>. Businesses should also adhere to the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/safemanagementsector">sector-specific guidelines</a> released by the respective agencies.

Businesses may also wish to refer to MTIâ€™s <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/05/MTI-Advisory-on-resumption-of-activities-from-2-June-2020.pdf" target="_blank">advisory</a> dated 19 May 2020, on the gradual resumption of business activities in phases starting from 2 June 2020.

All businesses are to comply with the following requirements: 
- All employees who have been working from home so far should continue to do so. 
- Employees should only return to the workplace where it is demonstrably necessary, for purposes that cannot be carried out via telecommuting (e.g. to access specialised terminals or dedicated machines, or to complete a contract or transaction that is legally required to be completed in person and on-site).

Please view the infographic below for an overview of the safe management measures.
