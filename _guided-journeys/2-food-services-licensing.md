The [GoBusiness Licensing portal](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences) is a pro-enterprise digitalisation effort to enable a simpler, faster and better process for businesses to apply for licenses, permits and certificates from the government. The initiative aims to help business owners save time and reduce compliance cost so that they can focus on their core business.
