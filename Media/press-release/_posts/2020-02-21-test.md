In the Ministry of Finance (MOF)’s Budget for 2020, a large amount of focus and resources go into helping businesses and industries overcome recent challenges.

Singapore’s economy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019, its weakest growth since the financial crisis of 2008.

Just as the global economy was beginning to recover, the COVID-19 outbreak hit unexpectedly last month, said Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, bringing “new uncertainties”.

In response, many of the initiatives announced in this year’s Budget aim to protect the jobs of local workers as a “foremost concern”, followed by helping enterprises with cashflow to tide through the tough season.


The Government has set up a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package that will help implement a wide range of measures.

Here’s what businesses in Singapore can take away.

Defraying Wage Costs For Employers
To help ensure that Singaporeans stay employed, a new Jobs Support Scheme will be introduced to subsidise the wages of local workers.

Employers will receive an 8% cash grant of each employee’s monthly salary, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600, for three months. This applies to employees who are Singaporeans or Permanent Residents (PRs).

This amounts to a S$1.3 billion payout in total, which employers will receive by 31 July 2020.

An existing Wage Credit Scheme will also receive a S$1.1 billion enhancement to support salary increases for local workers.

The scheme will now co-fund 20% of wage increases in 2019, and 15% of wage increases in 2020, for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly income of up to S$5,000.

Corporate Tax Rebates And Working Capital Loans
All tax-paying companies will be given a 25% corporate income tax rebate for the year of assessment 2020, capped at S$15,000 per company.

Businesses can also expect enhanced tax treatments for one year, including faster write-down of investments in plants and machinery, and renovation and refurbishment incurred for the year of assessment 2021.

To give Singapore businesses easier access to working capital, the Enterprise Financing Scheme’s Working Capital Loan will double its maximum loan quantum to S$600,000.

The Government will take on 80% of the risk of the loan, increased from the current 50% to 70%.

Additionally, tenants and lessees of government-managed properties can request for more flexible rental payments like instalment plans, to be approved on a case-by-case basis.

Additional Support For Sectors Hit Hardest By COVID-19
Budget 2020 identifies tourism, aviation, retail, food services and point-to-point land transport services as sectors most directly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. These sectors will receive additional help on top of the measures mentioned above.

Businesses under these five sectors will enjoy an extended funding period for re-skilling workers, increased from three months to a maximum of six months.

In tourism, hotels, serviced apartments and event venues can expect property tax rebates of 30% on their accommodations and function rooms for the year 2020.

Rental rebates will also be rolled out for shops at Changi Airport, while the airport itself gets a 15% property tax rebate.

Previously announced, taxi and private-hire drivers will receive a S$77 million support package to tide them through drops in business.

In the retail and food industry, hawker stall owners and commercial tenants in government-managed facilities will get a month’s rental waiver and half a month’s rental waiver respectively.
