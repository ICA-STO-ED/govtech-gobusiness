### **Construction, Facilities Management and Critical Public Infrastructure**

1. Companies involved in epidemic control (e.g. sanitation, disinfection, cleaning, laundry)
2. Defence and Security firms, supporting firms and establishments protecting buildings and homes 
3. Development project that support essential services or national security 
4. Companies involved in epidemic control (e.g. sanitation, disinfection, cleaning, laundry)



1. Selected development projects assessed to be in critical stages of construction and are unable to stop due to potential safety risks 
2. Construction work in progress for (i) critical public infrastructure, (ii) maintenance and services to ensure public safety, and (iii) emergency repairs & maintenance
3. The following construction works should be allowed to continue:
: a. Safety critical works.  These are works assessed by BCA to be in critical stages of construction, and that cannot be stopped suddenly due to potential public safety risks.  However, these projects should be wound down to a state where works may be safely stopped. Examples:  deep basement excavation works, deep tunneling works (which could lead to sinkholes/collapses if stopped).
: b. Projects that support essential services or are necessary for public safety. These are projects that support the supply of essential services (water, electricity) to the public, or that are essential to maintain public safety. Examples: utility projects that would cause disruptions to the public  if stopped (e.g. water, gas, sewerage/drainage, comms, power lines), limited HIP internal works (e.g. completion of toilet), emergency works to ensure structural safety of a building, urgent repairs to public infrastructure to ensure public safety.



1. Provision of facilities management services for buildings and infrastructure (e.g. plumbing, electrical works, conservancy services)
: a. All firms involved in the provision of facilities management (FM) services for buildings and infrastructure should be allowed to continue working
: b. This should include all FM firms, as well as firms involved in the maintenance of key equipment such as:
: i. Air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems;
: ii. Fire protection systems;
: iii. Security and surveillance systems (such as CCTVs);
: iv. Electrical and plumbing works; and
: v. Building management systems



1. Provision of lift and escalator (L&E) maintenance services, and facilities management (FM) services for buildings and infrastructure (e.g. plumbing, electrical works, conservancy services) 
: a. All firms involved in the provision of maintenance services for lifts and escalators should be allowed to continue working, in order to maintain public safety.



1. Landscaping for public safety (e.g. tree pruning a.k.a. arboriculture services; shrub pruning, grass cutting a.k.a. horticulture services) 
: a. Essential landscape sector services critical for maintaining public safety should be allowed to continue.  Trees that are not properly maintained can pose a threat to public safety. Other greenery may also need to be maintained to prevent hazards. If public parks are to remain open, there is also a need for a basic level of operations. Examples: tree inspections and pruning, removal of fallen trees/diseased trees, pruning of shrubs that may obstruct traffic, enforcement of safe distancing measures at parks, basic park maintenance to remove hazards/maintain hygiene.



1. Animal-related services for public safety (e.g. veterinary services â€“ need to maintain surveillance of health of companion animals; managing wildlife like monkeys, snakes, boars)
: a. Essential health inspections of animals at the borders are necessary for bio surveillance. Animal and wildlife management services should also be allowed to continue to enable our parks to remain open.  Such services are essential to mitigate potential human-animal incidents.
