The Government will allow the gradual resumption of businesses, in phases, with effect from 2 June 2020. 

The list of permitted services, and the corresponding Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) codes, that will be allowed to resume operations in Phase 1 can be found here <pdf file – both to view and downloadable>.  

Please note that your SSIC code should correspond with the “primary business activity” in your business registration records with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). You should ensure that your business activity is in line with your selected SSIC code. 

If you do not know your SSIC code, you can login to <a href="https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/">BizFile+</a> using your CorpPass credentials.
