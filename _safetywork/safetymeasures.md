#### **1. SafeEntry**

![SafeEntry](/images/safeentrypic.png "SafeEntry")

SafeEntry is a free-for-use Cloud-based visitor registration system. Visitors scan a QR code using their SingPass Mobile app, give consent to share their name and contact information with the building managers, and make the necessary declaration required. This online service will be regularly updated to reflect the latest advisory and guidelines. Using this system allows businesses to verify user identity with data from Government sources to facilitate their tracing work should the need arise. 

**<ins>Places where SafeEntry must be deployed (with effect from 12 May 2020)</ins>**

From 12 May 2020, all businesses and services that are in operation at the following list of facilities/places must deploy the SafeEntry system to log the check-in and check-out of employees and visitors.
- Workplaces e.g. offices, factories
- Schools and educational institutes
- Healthcare facilities e.g. hospitals, clinics
- Community care facilities e.g. childcare, nursing homes
- Other services in enclosed places or involving close contact e.g. banks, post offices, hairdressers/barbers
- Retail outlets e.g. convenience stores, pharmacies, heartland retail shops
- Supermarkets
- Selected popular wet markets (Geylang Serai Market; Blk 505, Jurong West St 52; Blk 20/21/ Marsiling Lane; and Blk 104/105, Yishun Ring Road)
- Malls

All taxis and private-hire cars should also gradually deploy SafeEntry, and we urge commuters to cooperate by checking in and out of the vehicles to support contact tracing efforts.

This list will be updated as more activities and services are resumed.

#### **2. TraceTogether**

![Trace Together](/images/tracetogether.png "Trace Together")

TraceTogether is a mobile app that supports Singapore’s efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing.

Through the exchange of short-distance Bluetooth signals between mobile phones with the installed app, each phone can detect other participating TraceTogether phones that are in close proximity. The app estimates the distance between users, and the duration of such encounters. Records of these encounters are stored locally, in encrypted form, on each user’s phone for 21 days (covering the incubation period of the virus).

If a user is interviewed by a contact tracer for activity mapping, he can authorise the uploading of his TraceTogether data to Ministry of Health (MOH). MOH will then decipher the data and get the mobile numbers of the user’s close contacts within a period of time. This facilitates the contact tracing process, and enables contact tracers to inform close contacts of confirmed cases more expeditiously.
