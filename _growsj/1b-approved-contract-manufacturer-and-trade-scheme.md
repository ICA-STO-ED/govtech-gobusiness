## Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trade (ACMT) Scheme

Contract manufacturers and traders under this scheme are relieved of the need to account for GST on value added activities supplied to non-GST registered overseas customers or overseas persons who are registered under the Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime as a pay-only person.

The ACMT Scheme is a scheme designed to relieve businesses (e.g. local contract manufacturers) that have substantial business with overseas clients* of the need to account for GST on value added activities performed on the goods of such clients.

*An overseas client refers to an overseas customer who is not GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the OVR regime.
